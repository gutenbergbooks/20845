		<h2 class="title">A PILGRIMAGE TO PENSHURST.</h2>

		<h3 class="byline">BY C. A. ALEXANDER.</h3>

		<p><span class="first_word">One</span> of the admirers of GoÃ«the, commenting on his characteristic
		excellencies, has remarked that he is the most <em>suggestive</em> of writers.
		Were we to seek an epithet by which to describe the architectural remains
		and historical monuments of England, with reference to their
		impression on the mind of an observer, perhaps no better could offer
		itself than that which has been thus applied to the works of the great
		German. In the property of awakening reflection by bringing before
		the mind that series of events whose connection with the progress of
		modern civilization has been most direct and influential, and of recalling
		names which, to the American at least, sound like household words,
		they stand unrivalled. Our manners, our customs, our national constitution
		itself, may be said to have grown up beneath the shelter of
		these venerable structures, whose associations ally them in a manner
		scarcely less striking with those wider developments of social and political
		reason in which we believe the welfare of our species to be involved.
		Who is there, that, standing within &#8216;the great hall of William
		Rufus,&#8217; can forget how often it has been the theatre of those mighty
		conflicts, in which, however slowly and reluctantly, error and prejudice
		have been compelled to relax their hold on the human mind? Dr.
		Johnson has spoken to us, in his usual stately phrase, of patriotism re-invigorated
		and of piety warmed amid the scenes of Marathon and
		Iona; but where is the Marathon which appeals to us so forcibly as the
		field consecrated by the blood of a Hamden or a Falkland? and where
		the Iona which is so eloquent with recollections as the walls which have
		echoed to the voices of a Ridley and a Barrow?</p>

		<p>It is true indeed, that the recollections of many other lands, as associated
		with their monuments, lay much stronger hold upon the imagination
		than those of England. Of the former we might say that there
		was about them more of the element of poetry; of the latter, that they
		furnish an ampler share of materials for reflection. One great moral,
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page308" name="page308"></a>308</span>&#8216;the comprehensive text of the Hebrew preacher,&#8217; the invariable &#8216;vanity
		of vanities,&#8217; is alike inscribed upon all the vestiges of human greatness.
		For the rest, a serene and touching beauty lingers around and hallows
		every relic which attests the hand of Phidias, or marks the country of
		Pericles and Epaminondas. No lapse of time, no process of decay, will
		ever wholly exorcise that spirit of stateliness and command which sits
		enthroned amid the ruins of the &#8216;Eternal City,&#8217; as her own Marius once
		sate amid the ruins of a rival capital. But in all that regards a common
		standard of opinions, institutions and interests, and in the facility
		of reasoning as respects these, from the experience and practice of one
		time and people to those of another, we cannot but feel that a vast gulf
		has interposed between our own age and that which is commemorated
		by the monuments of Greece and Rome. The venerable genius of antiquity,
		seated among crumbling arches and broken columns, has but
		little to say to us respecting those questions which most deeply agitate
		and unceasingly perplex the busy and the thinking part of mankind at
		the present day. No response are we to expect from that quarter, concerning
		our bank-laws and our corn-laws; our systems of credit and
		of commerce; our endless disquisitions on the balance of power and of
		parties, on the rights of suffrage and of conscience. While we reserve
		to the theorist the privilege of adorning his theme by allusions to the
		polity of Lycurgus and Numa, we are sensible that the practical statesman
		who trusts himself to such examples will be constantly liable to be
		deluded by false parallels and imperfect analogies. A voice, like that
		which is said to have startled the mariner of old on the coasts of Ionia,
		and to have announced to him the cessation of oracles, comes to us from
		all the remains of pagan antiquity, warning us that the spirit of that
		ancient civilization has departed with its forms: and while it bids us
		look forward to a new destiny for the human race, it teaches us that
		the maxims and the oracles by which that destiny must be guided, are
		to be sought elsewhere than in the Republic of Plato and the grottos
		of Egeria.</p>

		<p>Compared, then, with the monuments of classic antiquity, those of
		England claim the distinction of being associated with an order of things
		which is still existing and still in process of development: compared
		with those of the rest of christian Europe, they recall a progress, which,
		much more consistently than in other countries, has tended in the direction
		of popular rights and constitutional liberty. The reader of English
		history indeed has too often occasion to blush for the vices or mourn
		for the madness of his species, as the spectator who looks upon the grim
		fastnesses of the Tower, or into the gloomy purlieus of St. Giles&#8217;, will
		need but little else to remind him of the despotism and inequality which
		have pursued liberty into this her boasted and sea-girt retreat. But
		the Bastile, certainly, did not look in its day upon scenes of less flagrant
		atrocity than the &#8216;towers of Julius;&#8217; while this advantage has always
		obtained in favor of the latter, that he who turned with disgust or terror
		from that image of despotic pride and violence, might behold at no great
		distance the piles of Westminster, the seats of law and legislation,
		where the irrepressible spirit of freedom in the bosom of the Commons
		was still nursing its resentment or muttering its remonstrances at seasons
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page309" name="page309"></a>309</span>of the deepest gloom and depression. Henry VIII. might have
		heard that voice mingling with the groans of his victims; Charles II.
		could not altogether shut it out from the scenes of his midnight revel
		and debauchery. But no such hopeful contrast meets us in the features
		or the history of the neighboring continent. Democracy, it is true, the
		rough and hardy growth of the German forests, struck an earlier root
		and flourished at first with better promise <em>there</em> than in England. But
		this different fortune awaited it on the continent and the island; that in
		the former it was soon rooted out, and required in modern times the most
		violent and sanguinary efforts to reproduce it; in the latter it has constantly
		survived and struggled through every disaster toward a hopeful
		development. Such has been the different political fate of two branches
		of the great Teutonic family; let us observe whether some corresponding
		difference does not make itself manifest in the aspect of their respective
		countries.</p>

		<p>It might have been readily anticipated that the maintenance of the
		popular right as a constitutional principle, operating through a long
		course of ages, would have produced not only a sturdy independence
		among the bulk of the English nation, but to some extent also, a local
		independence of the country as regards the capital and the court. It
		might have been foreseen, that instead of concentrating every separate
		ray of genius and renown into one grand <em>halo</em> around the throne, this
		habitual effort of the popular mind would have had a tendency to scatter
		those rays more equally over the land, making the green valley and the
		sequestered hamlet rejoice, each in the memory of its bard or hero.
		Such might have been our prognostic from the political condition of
		England as compared with that of the continent, and such will be found
		upon observation to have been the result. A French poet aptly describes
		the centralizing influences of his own capital as regards France,
		when he tells us that &#8216;at Paris people <em>live</em>, elsewhere they only <em>vegetate</em>.&#8217;
		One great holocaust of talents, reputations and fortunes forever ascends
		there to the glory of the Grand Nation, absorbing every thing, assimilating
		every thing to itself, and leaving the country widowed of its interest and
		shorn of its appropriate graces. The poet, whose footsteps on the sunny
		plains of Provence would have long brightened in the traditions of its
		peasantry; the hero, whose name would have sufficed to confer undying
		interest on some old <i>chÃ¢teau</i> of the Jura; the orator, whose leisure
		hours might have made some French Tusculum on the banks of
		the Loire forever fresh with the memory of associated honors; all these
		have alike hastened to Paris, identified themselves once for all with its
		crowds, and added whatever <i>prestige</i> might attend their own names
		through future ages to the already overshadowing <i>prestige</i> of that wonderful
		city. They point you there to the house where the great Corneille
		breathed his last; it is hard by the metropolitan church of St.
		Roche, and scarcely more than a bow-shot from the Tuilleries, as if the
		poet of Cinna and Polyeucte could not render up his breath in peace
		except in the neighborhood of those high dignitaries, into whose lips he
		had breathed while living so much of his own grandeur and elevation;
		but who reminds you of the hills of his native Normandy, or points you
		to the humble chamber or the peaceful valley where &#8216;gorgeous Tragedy
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page310" name="page310"></a>310</span>in sceptred pall&#8217; first swept before the eyes of his dawning fancy? No;
		if you would recall the memory of Corneille through the medium of
		places familiar with his presence when living, you must repair to the
		Hotel de Rambouillet, in one of the most noisy and unpoetic quarters of
		Paris.</p>

		<p>Now with respect to England, all this is as nearly as possible reversed.
		The political influences spoken of before, operating no doubt
		with others of which it is unnecessary to speak, have acted dispersively
		on the sum of national reputations, and equitably allotted to almost every
		part of the fair island some <i>parcenary</i> share of fame, some hallowing
		memory, like a household genius, to preside over and endear its localities.
		London has not, like Paris, proved itself in this the insatiate
		Saturn of the national offspring. If you inquire, for instance, for memorials
		of the life and presence of Shakspeare, it is not probable, as in the
		case of Corneille, that you will be referred to the crowded streets and
		squares of the metropolis, though his active life was passed and his unrivalled
		fame achieved there; but far away to the west, where Nature
		received him on her flowery lap, beside his own Avon; in the shades
		where his genius first grew familiar with the shapes of beauty, sublimity,
		and terror, and whither he retired at last &#8216;to husband out life&#8217;s
		taper&#8217; amid the common charities of home; to this spot it is that you
		must repair, if you would drink freshly of that well-spring of associations
		which hallows the footsteps of England&#8217;s immortal dramatist. In
		like manner, one might say, that it is not in the sumptuous galleries of
		Holland House, neighbored by the crowds and tumult of the parks, that
		the admirer of Addison would find it most easy to call up the image of
		the sage; but in that quiet meadow which he used to frequent on the
		banks of the Cheswell, when evening is gathering on the tops of the
		lofty elms and around the gray towers of Magdalen, how pleasing and
		unforced the effort which recalls him to our imaginations!</p>

		<p>And so too of others. Gray has not made the country church-yard
		immortal in song alone, but has laid himself to rest with all the memories
		of that imperishable strain around him, beneath as green a sod as
		wraps the head of the humblest peasant for whom his muse implored
		&#8216;the passing tribute of a sigh.&#8217; The pensive shade of Cowper beckons
		to the groves of Olney; and the melancholy ghost of Chatterton, (kindred
		to Cowper only in his woes and his genius,) has fled from the
		crowded thoroughfares of London, where he sank oppressed in the turmoil
		of life, to haunt forever, in the eyes of the dreaming enthusiast, those
		dim aisles of St. Mary Redcliffe in Bristol, whence he drew the spells
		which immortalized but could not preserve him. And thus will it be
		when the lights of to-day, the bards of living renown, shall have passed
		away, but not to be forgotten. No one will then think of tracing
		Wordsworth, or Moore, or Southey, amid the dusky lanes and glittering
		saloons of the metropolis, but the lakes of Cumberland and the bowers
		of Wiltshire will still rejoice in the ever-brightening honors of associated
		genius. Even the hardier spirits of the isle, whose destiny has called
		them to the rougher paths of life, to the battle-field or the senate, away
		from the haunts of nature and the Muse; even these have seldom failed,
		in the intervals of busier life, to remember the charms of the rural life
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page311" name="page311"></a>311</span>of England, and in giving their more familiar hours to its enjoyments,
		have bequeathed to many a fair spot a heritage of memories more precious
		than wealth, and which the pilgrims of after ages will not willingly
		let perish.</p>

		<p>It is to one of these provincial retreats, (if such they may be called,
		when the migratory habits of society are rendering them daily more
		known and frequented) that the foregoing remarks are designed to lead
		the attention of the indulgent reader.</p>

		<p>&#8216;The southern district of Kent,&#8217; says Gibbon, &#8216;which borders on Sussex
		and the sea, was formerly overspread with the great forest Anderida;
		and even now retains the denomination of the Weald, or Woodland.&#8217;
		On the verge of this region, now diversified with the traces of
		civilization and culture, and at the distance of some thirty miles from
		London, stands Penshurst, for many generations the domain and seat of
		the illustrious family of Sydney. The mansion is of that class termed
		castellated houses, as retaining some of the features of the feudal castle,
		but accommodated to the more secure and less circumspect usages of a
		later age. In itself, it presents perhaps no very striking example of the
		merits or defects of its class, but it claims a much higher distinction in
		having been the birth-place and paternal home of Sir Philip Sydney.</p>

		<p>To what name can we point which is more brightly adorned than his
		with all the accomplishments of the soldier, the courtier and the scholar?
		Still rises upon the memory through the mists of three centuries that
		touching legend of Zutphen, where the wounded hero waived from his
		lips the cup of water because it was more needed by the dying comrade
		at his side; and the pure morality and lofty chivalry which animate
		the &#8216;Arcadia,&#8217; still bear witness to us of the personal merit of this pride
		and ornament of the English court. His sagacious but selfish mistress,
		Elizabeth, once stood, we are told, between him and the proffered crown
		of Poland, as being loth to part (so she expressed herself,) with him who
		was &#8216;the jewel of her time.&#8217; She is reported too to have denied him on
		another occasion the permission which he earnestly sought, of connecting
		his fame and fortunes with those trans-atlantic enterprises which
		were already beginning to crown with success and distinction the efforts
		of such men as Drake and Frobisher. This last is a field of adventure
		upon which we must still regret that Sir Philip was not allowed to enter.
		The New World was then no less the region for romantic enterprise
		than profitable exertion, although the explorers of these distant
		climes had too often sunk the generosity of the soldier in the rapacity of
		the spoiler. In Sir Philip Sydney the world of Columbus would have
		had a visitor of a different order. To the courage of Smith and the accomplishments
		of Raleigh he would have added a spirit of honor and
		moderation peculiarly his own, and we should still have delighted to
		trace the impressions of his genius and virtue in the early annals of our
		continent. But his fate was destined to a different scene; and his career,
		though thus limited by a jealous sovereign and an early death, has left
		little which we can reasonably deplore but its brevity; while that brevity
		itself throws around his character the last touches of romantic interest,
		and assigns him the not unenviable lot of having carried off the
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page312" name="page312"></a>312</span>rewards of age without its infirmities, and borne a maturity of honors
		into the safe asylum of a premature grave:</p>

		<div class="poem">
			<div class="stanza">
				<p>&#8216;Invida quem Lachesis raptum,</p>
				<p>Dum numerat palmas, credidit esse senem.&#8217;</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>In this age of literary and multifarious pilgriming, it cannot be unacceptable
		to propose an excursion to a mansion dignified by its associations
		with such a name. Neither is it a slight recreation to him who
		has been confined for weeks and months within the dusky enclosures of
		London, to break his bounds and emerge into the breathing fields of Surry
		and Kent. The father of English poetry, and poet of English pilgrims,
		Chaucer himself, stands ready to accompany us for at least a small portion
		of our route: it was along the road on which we enter, that he conducted,
		ages ago, those pilgrims to the shrine of Canterbury who still
		live in his verses; and we may glance at the Tabard Inn whence they
		set forth, and indulge our fancy with the thought of their quaint equipments,
		while we betake ourselves to the modern &#8216;hostelrie&#8217; of the Elephant
		and Castle, and commit our persons to the modern comforts of an
		English coach. Alas! for the fickleness of a world which changes its
		idols almost as often and as easily as its fashions. Time was when we
		should have found this great highway strewn with devotees hurrying to
		the shrine of St. Thomas Ã  Becket. But now, though we might detect,
		no doubt, in the throng around us, the counterpart of each individual
		whom Chaucer committed to his living canvass; of the knight who &#8216;loved
		chevalrie&#8217; and the Frankelein &#8216;who loved wine;&#8217; of the young squire
		&#8216;with his locks in presse,&#8217; and the fair lady who</p>

		<div class="poem">
			<div class="stanza">
				<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8216;of her smiling was ful simple and coy,</p>
				<p>Her gretest oathe n&#8217;as but by Seint Eloy;&#8217;</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>all as intent as of old upon objects not less fleeting, and changed in little
		but the fashion of their attire; now there is none so poor as to do
		reverence to the martyr-prelate for the sake of those merits which were
		once thought a sufficient covering for the sins of countless followers.</p>


		<p>As the great eastern artery of London, the road which we have thus
		far followed begins to distribute its living mass into the successive provincial
		avenues which diverge from it, we find ourselves included in
		that portion of the throng, whom the pursuit of health or pleasure conducts
		toward Tonbridge.<a href="#fn1" class="fnmarker" title="This route leads, among other villages..." id="fnm1" name="fnm1">1</a> The high and level country which under
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page313" name="page313"></a>313</span>the name of &#8216;Downs&#8217;<a href="#fn2" class="fnmarker" title="Dunum or Duna..." id="fnm2" name="fnm2">2</a> forms the northern and western boundary of
		Kent, sinks by a sudden and steep declivity on its eastern edge; which
		edge the geologists tell us was once washed by a primeval ocean, and
		is still seamed by the ineffaceable traces of its currents and storms. For
		ourselves it forms a vantage-ground from which we seem to look at one
		glance over almost the whole of that fair province which stretches nearly
		to the continent, and lifts the white cliffs of Albion above the surges of
		the British channel. We think of the day when the standard bearer of
		the tenth legion bore the eagle of CÃ¦sar to the shore amid the cries of
		the opposing Britons; and of the still more signal day when Augustine
		displayed the cross before the eyes of the softened and repentant Saxons.
		We think too of the beings with whose memories Shakspeare has peopled
		this portion of the Isle; of Lear and Cordelia, of Edgar, Gloster,
		and Kent; of that night of horrors upon the stormy heath, and that
		scene of unutterable tenderness and heart-break on the sands of Dover.
		Unbidden, as we gaze over the fair and varied prospect, the words of
		the same great dramatist rise to our lips, in his appropriation of the
		sentiments and language of the first conqueror of Britain:</p>

		<div class="poem">
			<div class="stanza">
				<p>&#8216;Kent in the commentaries CÃ¦sar writ,</p>
				<p>Is termed the civil&#8217;st place of all this isle;</p>
				<p>Sweet is the country because full of riches,</p>
				<p>The people liberal, active, valiant, wealthy.&#8217;</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>But the riches of Kent must be spoken of with due limitations. Those
		geological changes and formations before alluded to, which have marked
		the track of wealth across the British islands by deposits of mineral
		coal, as clearly as if it had been traced in sunbeams, have bequeathed
		no such sources of sub-terrene affluence to Kent. Nor has nature been
		more than parsimonious (to say the least) with respect to the superficial
		qualities of its soil. We have only, however, to cast our eyes on
		a topographical chart of Kent, to see how beneficently these disadvantages
		are balanced by considerations of a different sort. Washed along
		a vast line of coast by the ocean, and bordered to an equal or greater
		extent by the Thames; penetrated by the navigable Medway, and watered
		by such fertilizing streams as the Eden and the Ton; traversed
		through its whole length by that ancient highway of Dover, which
		figured in the itineraries of the Romans, and which still conveys much
		of the ceaseless intercourse between England and the Continent; its
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page314" name="page314"></a>314</span>coast studded with towers and harbors; its interior sprinkled with hamlets,
		parks, cities, and baronial residences; claiming, finally, to be the
		episcopal head and fountain of ecclesiastical dignity for the whole
		British empire; we can readily see how Kent may vindicate to itself
		the praise conveyed in the lines of Shakspeare as the abode of a liberal,
		active, valiant, and even wealthy people.</p>

		<p>Nor is this flattering ascription of personal qualities unsupported by
		the facts of its local history. To the great Roman conqueror the inhabitants
		of this part of Britain opposed a resistance, which taught him,
		as he indirectly confesses, to look back with many a wistful glance
		toward the coast where he had left his transports, but ill-assured against
		the ocean or the enemy. Against the Norman conqueror, likewise,
		when all the rest of the island had yielded implicitly to his sway and to
		the substitution of feudal for native usages, the people of Kent still made
		good their old hereditary law of <i>Gavelkind</i>. More than once in after
		times, stung by oppression or inflamed by zeal, they have drawn together
		in a spirit of tumultuous resistance, and borne their remonstrances
		to the very gates of the national capital. Connecting this history
		and character with their maritime position, we are led to apply a remark
		which our American historian Prescott has generalized from the circumstances
		of a people not dissimilarly situated. &#8216;The sea-board,&#8217;
		says that admirable writer, &#8216;would seem to be the natural seat of liberty.
		There is something in the very presence, in the atmosphere of
		the ocean, which invigorates not only the physical but the moral energies
		of man.&#8217; Or as Wordsworth has expressed the same idea, with
		an extension of it, no less just than poetical, to another class of natural
		objects:</p>

		<div class="poem">
			<div class="stanza">
				<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">Two</span> voices are there; one is of the sea,</p>
				<p>One of the mountains; each a mighty voice:</p>
				<p>In both from age to age thou didst rejoice,</p>
				<p>They were thy chosen music, Liberty!&#8217;</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>It has already been said that our route lay toward Tonbridge. True,
		those celebrated wells lie somewhat beyond Penshurst, yet few pilgrims
		will fail to visit them; and it may be permitted to glance aside from our
		immediate object to glean a very few observations from the customs of
		this fashionable watering-place. But the American visitor must not
		expect to meet at a watering-place in England precisely that aggregate of
		circumstances which goes to form his idea of the pleasures and privileges
		of one in his own country. There are restraints imposed by the circumstances
		of these elder lands, their necessity more than their choice, which
		must still at first sight appear forbidding and superfluous to the inhabitant
		of a new one. The rigid barriers of ceremony; the appearance of studied
		isolation and exclusiveness; the monotonous movement of the great
		social machine, organized to its minutest details, and regulated through
		all its processes; these at first may lead the visitor from the New
		World to suppose that he has fallen upon some region of persevering
		formality, where all is frost and show, perpetual glitter and unmeaning
		barrenness. But pierce these formal barriers of etiquette, dissolve by
		the requisite appliances this superficial frost-work of the English circles,
		and none, it is believed, will have any just reason to complain of coldness
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page315" name="page315"></a>315</span>and reserve. By the social barriers spoken of, are not meant the
		distinctions of rank in European society, or the conventional observances
		by which they are guarded, for these do not constitute in fact the
		points of repulsion by which a stranger is apt to be encountered. Still
		less do they mean those mental habits of suspicion, mystery and indirectness,
		which may infect communities as well as individuals. For
		these there is neither extenuation nor excuse. Rousseau has finely said:
		&#8216;<span lang="fr">Le premier pas vers le vice est de mettre du mystere aux actions innocentes;
		et quiconque aime Ã  se cacher, a tÃ´t ou tard raison de se
		cacher. Un seul prÃ©cepte de morale peut tenir lieu de tous les autres,
		c&#8217;est celui-ci: Ne fais, ni ne dis jamais rien que tu ne veuilles que
		tout le monde voie et entende. J&#8217;ai toujours regardÃ© comme le plus estimable
		des hommes ce Romain qui voulait que sa maison fÃ»t construite
		de maniÃ¨re qu&#8217;on vÃ®t tout ce qui s&#8217;y faisait.</span>&#8217; Whether the Englishman
		would be the first or the last to submit himself to this crucial test of
		<em>living in a transparent house</em>, we do not feel called upon to decide. The
		barriers, of which some justification has been attempted, are merely
		those formal observances by which society aims to protect itself from
		the intrusion of the unworthy and designing; which all must perceive
		to be in some degree necessary, even to personal independence; and
		which common-sense teaches us must be of greater extent and more
		rigorous application in a crowded capital than a country village, in an
		English Almacks than an American drawing-room. No one will deny
		that these barriers are high and strictly guarded in England; but it
		would be unreasonable to impute as a fault what is a dictate of prudence,
		or to infer that coldness and incivility must of course lurk under
		forms which have been manifestly imposed by the necessity of constant
		circumspection.</p>

		<p>Duly impressed with these considerations, the stranger will be less
		disposed to complain when arriving at any place of fashionable resort
		in England; at Tonbridge, for instance, one of the most aristocratic;
		he finds himself consigned to the solitary comfort of his own apartments,
		without the prospect of any of those periods of social reÃ¼nion, which
		elsewhere tend so strongly to break down the barriers of reserve and
		facilitate the process of introduction and acquaintance. Cardinal de
		Retz has told us, that the dinner-bell never fails to disperse a mob in
		France, and if English travellers are to be believed, it seldom fails to
		bring one together in an American hotel; but as a social summons, no
		such tocsin breaks the uniformity of the English <i>mÃ©nage</i>. The traveller
		may dine indeed in the public room, but it is at a separate table, on
		his separate repast; he is served with what viands, at what hour, he
		pleases, but no contiguity of position or interchange of friendly offices
		can remove the impalpable but impassable partition which divides him
		from his neighbors. He feels something of the air of the <em>penitentiary</em>
		in the very refinements of his luxurious <i>hostelrie</i>. But these are incidents
		not without their attendant advantages. If the stranger is thus
		separated from his fellows, he is at least saved, in turn, from the attempts
		of fraud, and the contact of impertinence. This is, in fact, the
		meaning of such arrangements, and if not exactly palatable, they are
		at any rate protective. But there are restrictions with regard to the
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page316" name="page316"></a>316</span>fairer part of creation, and his correspondence with them, which admit
		of no such topics of comfort and alleviation. We nowhere find it stated,
		by what steps it is permitted to the English suitor to proceed from
		the distant bow to the morning call, always in the presence of the mother,
		the aunt, or other watchful guardian; and thence by regular gradations
		to the heart and hand of the object of his wishes. But it is
		enough for our stranger to know, that whatever may be the laws of
		strategy, provided for such cases in other lands, here it is necessary to
		begin his approaches with the father, and to lay his lines of earliest
		circumvallation around the watchful mother. These distant out-works
		must be mastered before there is the slightest chance of communicating
		even a summons to the citadel. English travellers, therefore, express
		surprise at the artless confidence with which unmarried ladies in America
		commit themselves to the solitary chat with a comparative stranger,
		take his hand or his arm after a few hours&#8217; acquaintance, and expose
		themselves to the surprise of a <em>declaration</em> before the extent of his
		means or the respectability of his connexion have been discussed and
		settled. Between the merits of these different modes of procedure, the
		present writer has neither the wish nor the ability to arbitrate. They
		have their growth in such widely different states of society, that the reformer
		must be bold who should attempt to transpose or change them.
		It is sufficient for our present purpose to remark, that if the visitor at
		Tonbridge should have failed to make those preliminary advances just
		spoken of, his pleasures here, as an admirer of female loveliness, will
		most probably be limited to seeing the fair creatures ride on diminutive
		donkeys (such is the custom of Tonbridge) to the wells, there to drink
		the chalybeate and promenade the <i>pantiles</i>. But what then? If he
		have not the <i>entrÃ©e</i> of society, the charms of nature and the attractions
		of English scenery are spread before him. His guide-book will tell
		him of grotesque rocks upon lonely heaths where Druids may have
		worshipped; and of Bayham Abbey, with its mouldering walls and &#8216;antiquary
		ivy,&#8217; which still attests amidst its ruins the luxury and wealth
		of its ancient masters. He may look in one direction over the broad
		lands and towering spires of Eridge Castle, or turning in another, soon
		lose amidst the recollections of Penshurst and in the homage which the
		heart renders to departed virtue, all sense of the vexatious forms and
		frivolous though perhaps inseparable distinctions of modern society.</p>

		<p>Approaching Penshurst from Tonbridge, we alight at the ancient
		church which stands in close contiguity with the family mansion. A
		ramble amidst its graves, a walk through its solemn aisles, a moment&#8217;s
		pause among its darkened monuments, seems to be but a suitable preparation
		for our farther researches. It is scarcely possible to enter one
		of these venerable religious edifices of the old world, which form so
		striking a feature in its scenery, without feeling in some degree an impression
		as if the dim and solemn fane were peopled with shadows; as
		if indistinct forms were beckoning along its lonely aisles, or waiting the
		stranger&#8217;s approach in its deep and vaulted recesses. The building is
		not always of great extent, (this of Penshurst is not so,) but the impression
		seems to be the result not more of the solemn style of the building
		and its accessories, than of the admirable harmony which they preserve
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page317" name="page317"></a>317</span>with the recollections and associations of all around them. Hence it
		may well be doubted whether, if we could transport one of these time-honored
		structures to our own land, with all its architectural peculiarities,
		it would have for us exactly the meaning or the charms which it
		possesses at home. Our career is as yet too brief, our land too full of
		the sounds of enterprise and excitement; our interest lies too largely and
		exclusively in the present and the future. The dawning light and the
		keen air of morning (sÅvus equis oriens anhelis) are not, as represented
		by the poets, more uncongenial to the spectral shapes of night, than the
		recent origin and energetic action of our rising country to the dim traditions
		and mouldering memories which have grown incorporate with the
		weather-stains and damps of these hoary sanctuaries. At Penshurst in
		particular, so complete is this harmony between the ideal and the actual,
		and so strongly does it bring before us the image of the past, that it
		might seem no unnatural incident of our reverie, were the grave and
		reverend knight, the ancient head of the Sydneys and patron of the
		church, once more to enter with his retinue from the neighboring mansion
		and take his seat in the family chancel. But of that honored
		name nothing remains to Penshurst except the memory, and those
		fading inscriptions which inform us that they who slumber here bore it
		irreproachably in life, and have long since ceased from their earthly
		labors. Among these, however, we look in vain for the name of Sir
		Philip Sydney. He fell in a foreign land, and his country, we are told,
		mourned for him with a loud and poignant lamentation. His remains
		were afterward transferred to Saint Paul&#8217;s, where the ruin which fell
		at a later period upon the great national temple involved also the memorial
		of Sir Philip Sydney. But it matters less, since the achievements
		of his pen and sword have made all places where the name of England
		comes, his monument, and every heart which is alive to honor, a sanctuary
		for his memory.</p>

		<p>Let us then pass on to that venerable mansion which having witnessed
		many of the incidents of his life may still be considered the lasting
		memorial of his virtues. Before us rises a building irregular in
		its design, but presenting an extensive line of front, in which square
		towers and pointed gables, connected by walls of unequal height, succeed
		each other with that sort of caprice which is common in mansions of the
		same age. Entering through a spacious gate-way, we cross a quadrangular
		court, and gain access by an unfurnished passage to the great
		hall, which formed the distinguishing feature of the feudal homestead.
		In the vast extent of this apartment we perceive an image of the pride
		which gloried more in the number of its retainers than in the luxury or
		refinement of its accommodations. Oaken tables, and benches of the
		same homely material, stretched from side to side, show that our ancestors
		required but rude accessories to recommend to them the substantial
		enjoyments of their mighty repasts. Through lofty windows strengthened
		by mullions and decorated with intricate carvings, the light streams
		softened by neither blind nor curtain. The middle of the hall is occupied
		by a spacious hearth, around which gathered the friends and followers
		of the noble house; and the fire-utensils which still remain, and
		which seem destined for the consumption of entire forests, intimate that
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page318" name="page318"></a>318</span>the household gods which presided here dealt in no stinted or penurious
		economy. There was scarcely need of flue or chimney, for the smoke
		curling up among the interlacing rafters of the roof, might long gather
		in its ample cavity without threatening those below with serious inconvenience.
		It is curious to observe that when at length so obvious a contrivance
		as the chimney grew into more general use, its introduction was
		opposed by much the same sort of arguments as have in other ages resisted
		the encroachments of change and novelty. A moralist of the
		times has left us his recorded opinion, that nothing but agues and catarrhs
		had followed the abandonment of that old and genial practice
		which planted the fire in the middle of the room and left the smoke to
		spread its sable canopy aloft. Another peculiarity in this picture of
		ancient manners was the slightly-raised platform called the daÃ¯s, at the
		farther extremity of the hall, which reminds us of the distinction that
		was preserved even in the hours of convivial relaxation, between the
		family of the lord and its dependents. Nor was this distinction in general
		one of place alone: in most of the wealthy and noble houses of the
		period, it portended a corresponding distinction in the quality of the food.
		Hence in the homely times in which Ben Jonson has apostrophized Penshurst,
		it is mentioned as an honorable instance of the hospitality of its
		owner, that</p>

		<div class="poem">
			<div class="stanza">
				<p class="i4">&#8212;&#8212;&#8216;there each guest might eat,</p>
				<p>Without his fear, and of the lord&#8217;s own meat;</p>
				<p>Where the same beer, board, and self-same wine,</p>
				<p>That is his lordship&#8217;s, shall be also mine.&#8217;</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>&#8216;A strange topic of praise,&#8217; remarks Gifford, &#8216;to those who are unacquainted
		with the practice of those times; but in fact the liberal mode of
		hospitality here recorded was almost peculiar to this noble person. The
		great dined at long tables, (they had no other in their vast halls,) and
		permitted many guests to sit down with them; but the gradations of rank
		and fortune were rigidly maintained, and the dishes grew visibly coarser
		as they receded from the head of the table.&#8217; To sit below the salt, is a
		phrase with which the romances of Scott have made us familiar, and
		which originated, it seems, in the custom of placing a large salt-cellar near
		the middle of the table, not more for convenience than with reference to
		the distribution of the guests.</p>

		<p>The same spirit which presided over the appointments of this stately
		hall extended itself to the other apartments and remoter details of the
		household. Every where there is the same reference to the power and
		even the supervision of the lord, manifested in the long suites of rooms
		which open upon each other, (the hall just mentioned is commanded by a
		small window opening from a superior and adjacent apartment,) as if to
		give the master at one glance a view of the number and a knowledge
		of the pursuits of the inmates. The ideas of the architects of that age
		seem to have been limited in their object, to realizing an image of the
		great feudal principle of preÃ«minence and protection on the one side,
		submissiveness and reliance on the other. Hence designs and arrangements
		so little consistent with the privacy and personal independence
		which we regard at present as indispensable to every scheme of domestic
		accommodation. But these artists were not limited alone by a defective
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page319" name="page319"></a>319</span>conception of the objects of their art; they were also embarrassed in
		its execution by the unequal manner in which the different branches
		of it had been cultivated and improved. It is doubtless a remark which
		will admit of very general application, that the arts which may be made
		subservient to embellishment and magnificence, have always far outstripped
		those which only conduce to comfort and convenience. The
		savage paints his body with gorgeous colors, who wants a blanket
		to protect him from the cold; and nations have heaped up pyramids
		to enhance their sense of importance, who have dwelt contentedly in
		dens and caves of the earth. Something of the same incongruity may
		be remarked at Penshurst, and other English mansions of the same age
		and order; where we sometimes ascend to galleries of inestimable
		paintings over steps roughly hewn with the axe, and look upon ceilings
		of the most exquisite and elaborate carving suspended over floors which
		have never had the benefit of the joiner&#8217;s plane.</p>

		<p>In the tastes, too, and personal habits of that elder period, contrasts
		of a not less striking nature might be easily pointed out. We may
		doubt, for instance, whether beauty will ever array itself in apparel of
		more cost and profusion than that in which the high-born dames of
		Wresill and Penshurst swept through their stately apartments. Grandeur
		will never make its presence felt by a greater weight of ceremony,
		nor ever extend a more watchful and provident care to all the equipage
		of rank and ostentation. Flattery, we may safely assert, will never
		offer its incense in a more seductive form, than when it borrowed the
		pencil of Holbein and the lyre of Spenser. Yet these persons were the
		same who trode upon floors strewn with rushes, and deemed it a point
		of nicety and refinement if these were changed sufficiently often to prevent
		the soiling of their clothes. They are the same who dined without
		forks, and thought pewter dishes too great a luxury to be used in common
		by the highest nobility; who transported their ladies on pillions for
		want of coaches, and themselves struggled through mire for want of
		pavements; who, with a knowledge of the manufacture of glass, and
		possessed beyond ourselves of an exquisite skill in coloring it, were yet
		too frugal or careless to use it freely in lighting their houses. It was
		an age when the sick were plied with such delicate restoratives as
		&#8216;mummy and the flesh of hedge-hogs,&#8217; and tables loaded with such
		dainties as cranes, lapwings, sea-gulls, bitterns and curlews. Such is
		the unequal progress which is often maintained in habits of undistinguishing
		luxury and habits of genuine refinement; so great the difference
		between a state of society which aims at the gratification of pride,
		and one which contents itself with diffusing comfort and promoting security.</p>

		<p>It would be easy, no doubt, to draw from this sketch of ancient manners
		many reflections consoling to our own sense of superior comfort
		and discernment. But the subject is susceptible of being viewed under
		aspects not so flattering yet more instructive. Who is there gross enough
		to pride himself on superior wisdom because Kepler believed that the
		earth was a vast animal which breathed and reasoned, or to claim the
		palm of comparative merit because Sir Thomas More listened to the
		babbling of a pretended prophetess, and Luther waged what he considered
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page320" name="page320"></a>320</span>no visionary but actual combats with the powers of darkness.
		If then we have dwelt on the defects of an age when civilization was
		still struggling with the remains of barbarism, it is to foster no spirit of
		vain exultation: it is rather to turn with increased pleasure from those
		stains which disfigure the picture, to the contemplation of the more prominent
		and brilliant figures which occupy the fore-ground. We remember
		that upon times thus backward in many of the refinements of life,
		and scarcely yet freed from the dregs of medi-Åval darkness, genius
		and virtue have thrown a lustre by their presence, not merely sufficient
		to retrieve them from our scorn, but to make them in some respects the
		object of our admiration and even envy. Perhaps, if it were submitted
		to our choice to take our places at will in any circle which genius and
		merit have ever dignified and adorned, none could justly claim our preference
		over that of Penshurst, at the time when Sir Philip Sydney sate
		there in the same group with his lovely sister, the Countess of Pembroke,
		and with Edmund Spenser, the poet of &#8216;the FaÃ«rie Queen.&#8217; Of the
		first of these eminent persons, it is enough to say, that his own age conceded
		to him the style of &#8216;the Incomparable,&#8217; and that posterity has
		amply ratified the title. The second is known to us by that affectionate
		tribute of her brother&#8217;s love, which has identified the name of the
		Countess of Pembroke with his principal work; nor will the latest readers
		of English literature be forgetful of one whose memory Jonson has embalmed
		in the sweetest inscription that ever flowed from a poet&#8217;s pen.
		Of Spenser, the last but not least illustrious of the honored group, it
		is only necessary to say, that as he shared the hospitality, so he has not
		left unsung the praises of Penshurst. Where is the circle which shall
		again combine so many claims to our admiration and respect? What
		age shall presume to vaunt itself for genius or for virtue above the age
		of Sydney and of Spenser?</p>

		<p>Later times have added to the social and literary lustre of Penshurst.
		It has been still farther illustrated by the talents and fame of Algernon
		Sydney, whose name never fails to awaken the sympathies of every
		friend of liberty for his honorable labors and unhappy fate. It has
		numbered among its guests and its eulogists such men as Jonson,
		Waller, and Southey; finally, even in our own time it has seen its horizon
		momently illuminated by the brief but dazzling splendors of the
		poet Shelly. This last was of the lineage of Sydney, and shared the
		talents and proud integrity, but not the wisdom and milder virtues of his
		house. It only remains to say, that the dwelling and estate of the Sydneys
		has passed into other hands, but finds, it would seem, in Lord
		De Lisle a proprietor not insensible to the worth nor regardless of the
		memory of his far-famed predecessors.</p>

		<p>Thus the remarks intended, draw to an end. We leave the halls of
		Penshurst, and the gates of that venerated mansion close behind us forever.
		Even thus did they close ages ago upon him, the light and honor
		of that ancient house, who, leaving it in the glow of health, in the pride
		of manly beauty, in the aspirations of a high but not a haughty spirit,
		was destined never to cross that paternal threshold more. The blessings
		that went with him have mouldered on the lips that pronounced
		them; the tears that mourned his fall have dried upon the lids from
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page321" name="page321"></a>321</span>which they streamed; all who knew and loved, all who watched and
		wept for Sir Philip Sydney are silent in the dust to which he himself
		has long been gathered. Yet does not his spirit commune with ours as
		we tread the halls once familiar with his presence, or gaze upon those
		all but animated portraits which Penshurst still numbers among the
		richest of its treasures? Does nothing survive here of so much honor,
		so much courtesy, so much courage, to elevate us by its example and
		to inspire us with new hope, ere we turn again to tread the toilsome
		mazes of the world? Let the acknowledgments of all those who with
		no unworthy or unreflecting spirit have traced these paths, reply; or
		rather let the answer embody itself in the words of a poet, who, while
		expressing his own sense of the merits of Sydney, has but given a
		suitable expression to sentiments which find an echo in every bosom:</p>

		<p><span class="first_word">Before</span> the extension of commerce and manufactories in Europe, the
		hospitality of the rich and the great, from the sovereign down to the
		smallest baron, exceeded every thing which in the present times we can
		easily form a notion of. Westminster Hall was the dining-room of
		William Rufus, and might frequently perhaps not be too large for his
		company. It was reckoned a piece of magnificence in Thomas Ã 
		Becket that he strewed the floor of his hall with clear hay or rushes in
		the season, in order that the knights and squires who could not get seats
		might not spoil their fine clothes when they sat down on the floor to eat
		their dinner. The great Earl of Warwick is said to have entertained
		every day, at his different manors, thirty thousand people; and though
		the number may have been exaggerated, it must however have been
		very great to admit of such exaggeration. The personal expenses of
		the great proprietors having gradually increased with the extension of
		commerce and manufactures, it was impossible that the number of
		their retainers should not as gradually diminish. Having sold their
		birth-right, not like Esau, for a mess of pottage in time of hunger and
		necessity, but in the wantonness of plenty for trinkets and baubles, fitter
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page322" name="page322"></a>322</span>to be the play-things of children than the serious pursuits of men, they

		<h2 class="title">THE LEGEND OF DON RODERICK.</h2>

		<h3 class="subtitle">NUMBER TWO.</h3>
		<p><span class="first_word">The</span> course of our legendary narration now returns to notice the fortunes
		of Count Julian, after his departure from Toledo, to resume his
		government on the coast of Barbary. He left the Countess Frandina
		at Algeziras, his paternal domain, for the province under his command
		was threatened with invasion. In fact, when he arrived at Ceuta he
		found his post in imminent danger from the all-conquering Moslems.
		The Arabs of the East, the followers of Mahomet, having subjugated
		several of the most potent oriental kingdoms, had established their seat
		of empire at Damascus, where, at this time, it was filled by Waled
		Almanzor, surnamed &#8216;the Sword of God.&#8217; From thence the tide of
		Moslem conquest had rolled on to the shores of the Atlantic; so that all
		Almagreb, or Western Africa, had submitted to the standard of the prophet,
		with the exception of a portion of Tingitania, lying along the
		straits; being the province held by the Goths of Spain, and commanded
		by Count Julian. The Arab invaders were a hundred thousand strong,
		most of them veteran troops, seasoned in warfare and accustomed to victory.
		They were led by an old Arab general, Muza ben Nosier, to whom
		was confided the government of Almagreb; most of which he had himself
		conquered. The ambition of this veteran was to make the Moslem
		conquest complete, by expelling the Christians from the African shores;
		with this view his troops menaced the few remaining Gothic fortresses of
		Tingitania, while he himself sat down in person before the walls of Ceuta.
		The Arab chieftain had been rendered confident by continual success,
		and thought nothing could resist his arms and the sacred standard of the
		prophet. Impatient of the tedious delays of a siege, he led his troops
		boldly against the rock-built towers of Ceuta, and attempted to take the
		place by storm. The onset was fierce, and the struggle desperate: the
		swarthy sons of the desert were light and vigorous, and of fiery spirits;
		but the Goths, inured to danger on this frontier, retained the stubborn
		valor of their race, so impaired among their brethren in Spain. They
		were commanded, too, by one skilled in warfare and ambitious of renown.
		After a vehement conflict, the Moslem assailants were repulsed from all
		points, and driven from the walls. Don Julian sallied forth, and
		harassed them in their retreat; and so severe was the carnage, that the
		veteran Musa was fain to break up his camp, and retire confounded
		from the siege.</p>

		<p>The victory at Ceuta resounded throughout Tingitania, and spread
		universal joy. On every side were heard shouts of exultation mingled
		with praises of Count Julian. He was hailed by the people, wherever
		he went, as their deliverer, and blessings were invoked upon his head.
		The heart of Count Julian was lifted up, and his spirit swelled within
		him; but it was with noble and virtuous pride, for he was conscious of
		having merited the blessings of his country.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page325" name="page325"></a>325</span>In the midst of his exultation, and while the rejoicings of the people
		were yet sounding in his ears, the page arrived who bore the letter from
		his unfortunate daughter.</p>

		<p>&#8216;What tidings from the king?&#8217; said the count, as the page knelt
		before him: &#8216;None, my lord,&#8217; replied the youth, &#8216;but I bear a letter sent
		in all haste by the Lady Florinda.&#8217;</p>

		<p>He took the letter from his bosom and presented it to his lord. As
		Count Julian read it, his countenance darkened and fell. &#8216;This,&#8217; said
		he, bitterly, &#8216;is my reward for serving a tyrant; and these are the
		honors heaped on me by my country, while fighting its battles in a
		foreign land. May evil overtake me, and infamy rest upon my name,
		if I cease until I have full measure of revenge.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Count Julian was vehement in his passions, and took no counsel in
		his wrath. His spirit was haughty in the extreme, but destitute of true
		magnanimity, and when once wounded turned to gall and venom. A
		dark and malignant hatred entered into his soul, not only against Don
		Roderick, but against all Spain: he looked upon it as the scene of his
		disgrace, a land in which his family was dishonored: and, in seeking
		to avenge the wrongs he had suffered from his sovereign, he meditated
		against his native country one of the blackest schemes of treason that
		ever entered into the human heart.</p>

		<p>The plan of Count Julian was to hurl King Roderick from his throne,
		and to deliver all Spain into the hands of the infidels. In concerting
		and executing this treacherous plot, it seemed as if his whole nature
		was changed; every lofty and generous sentiment was stifled, and he
		stooped to the meanest dissimulation. His first object was to extricate
		his family from the power of the king, and to remove it from Spain before
		his treason should be known; his next, to deprive the country of its remaining
		means of defence against an invader.</p>

		<p>With these dark purposes at heart, but with an open and serene
		countenance, he crossed to Spain, and repaired to the court at Toledo.
		Wherever he came he was hailed with acclamations as a victorious
		general, and appeared in the presence of his sovereign radiant with the
		victory at Ceuta. Concealing from King Roderick his knowledge of
		the outrage upon his house, he professed nothing but the most devoted
		loyalty and affection.</p>

		<p>The king loaded him with favors; seeking to appease his own conscience
		by heaping honors upon the father in atonement of the deadly
		wrong inflicted upon his child. He regarded Count Julian, also, as a man
		able and experienced in warfare, and took his advice in all matters relating
		to the military affairs of the kingdom. The count magnified the
		dangers that threatened the frontier under his command, and prevailed
		upon the king to send thither the best horses and arms remaining from
		the time of Witiza, there being no need of them in the centre of Spain
		in its present tranquil state. The residue, at his suggestion, was stationed
		on the frontiers of Gallia; so that the kingdom was left almost
		wholly without defence against any sudden irruption from the south.</p>

		<p>Having thus artfully arranged his plans, and all things being prepared
		for his return to Africa, he obtained permission to withdraw his
		daughter from the court, and leave her with her mother, the Countess
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page326" name="page326"></a>326</span>Frandina, who, he pretended, lay dangerously ill at Algeziras. Count
		Julian issued out of the gate of the city, followed by a shining band
		of chosen followers, while beside him, on a palfrey, rode the pale and
		weeping Florinda. The populace hailed and blessed him as he passed,
		but his heart turned from them with loathing. As he crossed the bridge
		of the Tagus, he looked back with a dark brow upon Toledo, and raised
		his mailed hand and shook it at the royal palace of King Roderick,
		which crested the rocky height. &#8216;A father&#8217;s curse,&#8217; said he, &#8216;be upon
		thee and thine! May desolation fall upon thy dwelling, and confusion
		and defeat upon thy realm!&#8217;</p>

		<p>In his journeyings through the country, he looked round him with a
		malignant eye; the pipe of the shepherd, and the song of the husbandman,
		were as discord to his soul; every sight and sound of human
		happiness sickened him at heart, and, in the bitterness of his spirit, he
		prayed that he might see the whole scene of prosperity laid waste with
		fire and sword by the invader.</p>

		<p>The story of domestic outrage and disgrace had already been made
		known to the Countess Frandina. When the hapless Florinda came in
		presence of her mother, she fell on her neck, and hid her face in her
		bosom, and wept; but the countess shed never a tear, for she was a
		woman haughty of spirit and strong of heart. She looked her husband
		sternly in the face. &#8216;Perdition light upon thy head,&#8217; said she, &#8216;if thou
		submit to this dishonor. For my own part, woman as I am, I will assemble
		the followers of my house, nor rest until rivers of blood have
		washed away this stain.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Be satisfied,&#8217; replied the count; &#8216;vengeance is on foot, and will be
		sure and ample.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Being now in his own domains, surrounded by his relatives and
		friends, Count Julian went on to complete his web of treason. In this
		he was aided by his brother-in-law, Oppas, the Bishop of Seville: a
		man dark and perfidious as the night, but devout in demeanor, and
		smoothly plausible in council. This artful prelate had contrived to
		work himself into the entire confidence of the king, and had even prevailed
		upon him to permit his nephews, Evan and Siseburto, the exiled
		sons of Witiza, to return into Spain. They resided in Andalusia, and
		were now looked to as fit instruments in the present traitorous conspiracy.</p>

		<p>By the advice of the bishop, Count Julian called a secret meeting of
		his relatives and adherents on a wild rocky mountain, not far from Consuegra,
		and which still bears the Moorish appellation of &#8216;La Sierra de
		Calderin,&#8217; or the mountain of treason. When all were assembled,
		Count Julian appeared among them, accompanied by the bishop and by
		the Countess Frandina. Then gathering around him those who were of
		his blood and kindred, he revealed the outrage that had been offered to
		their house. He represented to them that Roderick was their legitimate
		enemy; that he had dethroned Witiza, their relation, and had now stained
		the honor of one of the most illustrious daughters of their line. The
		Countess Frandina seconded his words. She was a woman majestic in
		person and eloquent of tongue; and being inspired by a mother&#8217;s feelings,
		her speech aroused the assembled cavaliers to fury.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page327" name="page327"></a>327</span>The count took advantage of the excitement of the moment to unfold
		his plan. The main object was to dethrone Don Roderick, and give the
		crown to the sons of the late King Witiza. By this means they would
		visit the sins of the tyrant upon his head, and, at the same time, restore
		the regal honors to their line. For this purpose their own force would
		be sufficient; but they might procure the aid of Muza ben Nosier, the
		Arabian general in Mauritania, who would no doubt gladly send a part
		of his troops into Spain to assist in the enterprise.</p>

		<p>The plot thus suggested by Count Julian received the unholy sanction
		of Bishop Oppas, who engaged to aid it secretly with all his influence
		and means: for he had great wealth and possessions, and many retainers.
		The example of the reverend prelate determined all who might
		otherwise have wavered, and they bound themselves by dreadful oaths
		to be true to the conspiracy. Count Julian undertook to proceed to
		Africa and seek the camp of Muza, to negotiate for his aid, while the
		bishop was to keep about the person of King Roderick, and lead him
		into the net prepared for him.</p>

		<p>All things being thus arranged, Count Julian gathered together his
		treasure, and taking his wife and daughter and all his household, abandoned
		the country he meant to betray; embarking at Malaga for Ceuta.
		The gate in the wall of that city, through which they went forth, continued
		for ages to bear the name of <i>Puerta de la Cava</i>, or the gate of the
		harlot; for such was the opprobrious and unmerited appellation bestowed
		by the Moors on the unhappy Florinda.</p>

		<p>When Count Julian had placed his family in security in Ceuta, surrounded
		by soldiery devoted to his fortunes, he took with him a few
		confidential followers, and departed in secret for the camp of the Arabian
		Emir, Muza ben Nozier. The camp was spread out in one of
		those pastoral vallies which lie at the feet of the Barbary hills, with the
		great range of the Atlas mountains towering in the distance. In the
		motley army here assembled were warriors of every tribe and nation,
		that had been united by pact or conquest in the cause of Islem. There
		were those who had followed Muza from the fertile regions of Egypt,
		across the deserts of Barca, and those who had joined his standard from
		among the sun-burnt tribes of Mauritania. There were Saracen and
		Tartar, Syrian and Copt, and swarthy Moor; sumptuous warriors from
		the civilized cities of the east, and the gaunt and predatory rovers of
		the desert. The greater part of the army, however, was composed of
		Arabs; but differing greatly from the first rude hordes that enlisted
		under the banner of Mahomet. Almost a century of continual wars
		with the cultivated nations of the east had rendered them accomplished
		warriors; and the occasional sojourn in luxurious countries and populous
		cities, had acquainted them with the arts and habits of civilized
		life. Still the roving, restless, and predatory habits of the genuine son
		of Ishmael prevailed, in defiance of every change of clime or situation.</p>

		<p>Count Julian found the Arab conqueror Muza surrounded by somewhat
		of oriental state and splendor. He was advanced in life, but of a
		noble presence, and concealed his age by tinging his hair and beard
		with henna. The count assumed an air of soldier-like frankness and
		decision when he came into his presence. &#8216;Hitherto,&#8217; said he, &#8216;we
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page328" name="page328"></a>328</span>have been enemies; but I come to thee in peace, and it rests with thee
		to make me the most devoted of thy friends. I have no longer country
		or king. Roderick the Goth is an usurper, and my deadly foe; he has
		wounded my honor in the tenderest point, and my country affords me no
		redress. Aid me in my vengeance, and I will deliver all Spain into
		thy hands: a land far exceeding in fertility and wealth all the vaunted
		regions thou hast conquered in Tingitania.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The heart of Muza leaped with joy at these words, for he was a bold
		and ambitious conqueror, and having overrun all western Africa, had
		often cast a wistful eye to the mountains of Spain, as he beheld them
		brightening beyond the waters of the strait. Still he possessed the caution
		of a veteran, and feared to engage in an enterprise of such moment,
		and to carry his arms into another division of the globe, without the
		approbation of his sovereign. Having drawn from Count Julian the
		particulars of his plan, and of the means he possessed to carry it into
		effect, he laid them before his confidential counsellors and officers, and
		demanded their opinion. &#8216;These words of Count Julian,&#8217; said he, &#8216;may
		be false and deceitful; or he may not possess the power to fulfil his
		promises. The whole may be a pretended treason to draw us on to our
		destruction. It is more natural that he should be treacherous to us than
		to his country.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Among the generals of Muza was a gaunt swarthy veteran, scarred
		with wounds; a very Arab, whose great delight was roving and desperate
		enterprise; and who cared for nothing beyond his steed, his
		lance, and his scimitar. He was a native of Damascus; his name
		was Taric ben Zeyad; but, from having lost an eye, he was known
		among the Spaniards by the appellation of Taric el Tuerto, or Taric
		the one-eyed.</p>

		<p>The hot blood of this veteran Ishmaelite was in a ferment when he
		heard of a new country to invade, and vast regions to subdue; and he
		dreaded lest the cautious hesitation of Muza would permit the glorious
		prize to escape them. &#8216;You speak doubtingly,&#8217; said he, &#8216;of the words
		of this Christian cavalier, but their truth is easily to be ascertained.
		Give me four galleys and a handful of men, and I will depart with this
		Count Julian, skirt the Christian coast, and bring thee back tidings of
		the land, and of his means to put it in our power.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The words of the veteran pleased Muza ben Nosier, and he gave his
		consent; and Taric departed with four galleys and five hundred men,
		guided by the traitor Julian. This first expedition of the Arabs against
		Spain took place, according to certain historians, in the year of our
		Lord seven hundred and twelve; though others differ on this point, as
		indeed they do upon almost every point in this early period of Spanish
		history. The date to which the judicious chroniclers incline is that of
		seven hundred and ten, in the month of July. It would appear from
		some authorities, also, that the galleys of Taric cruised along the coasts
		of Andalusia and Lusitania, under the feigned character of merchant
		barks; nor is this at all improbable, while they were seeking merely to
		observe the land, and get a knowledge of the harbors. Wherever they
		touched, Count Julian despatched emissaries, to assemble his friends and
		adherents at an appointed place. They gathered together secretly at
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page329" name="page329"></a>329</span>Gezira Alhadra, that is to say, the Green Island; where they held a
		conference with Count Julian in presence of Taric ben Zeyad. Here
		they again avowed their readiness to flock to his standard whenever it
		should be openly raised, and made known their various preparations for
		a rebellion. Taric was convinced, by all that he had seen and heard,
		that Count Julian had not deceived them; either as to his disposition or
		his means to betray his country. Indulging his Arab inclinations, he
		made an inroad into the land, collected great spoil and many captives,
		and bore off his plunder in triumph to Muza, as a specimen of the riches
		to be gained by the conquest of the Christian land.</p>

		<p>On hearing the tidings brought by Taric el Tuerto, and beholding
		the spoil he had collected, Muza wrote a letter to the Caliph Waled
		Almanzor, setting forth the traitorous proffer of Count Julian, and the
		probability, through his means, of making a successful invasion of Spain.
		&#8216;A new land,&#8217; said he, &#8216;spreads itself out before our delighted eyes, and
		invites our conquest: a land, too, that equals Syria in the fertility of
		its soil, and the serenity of its sky; Yemen, or Arabia the happy, in
		its delightful temperature; India, in its flowers and spices; Hegias, in
		its fruits and flowers; Cathay, in its precious minerals; and Aden, in
		the excellence of its ports and harbors! It is populous also, and
		wealthy; having many splendid cities, and majestic monuments of ancient
		art. What is to prevent this glorious land from becoming the
		inheritance of the faithful? Already we have overcome the tribes of
		Berbery, of Zab, of Derar, of Zaara, Mazamuda, and Sus; and the
		victorious standard of Islem floats on the towers of Tangier. But four
		leagues of sea separate us from the opposite coast. One word from my
		sovereign, and the conquerors of Africa will pour their legions into
		Andalusia, rescue it from the domination of the unbeliever, and subdue
		it to the law of the Koran.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The Caliph was overjoyed with the contents of the letter. &#8216;God is
		great!&#8217; exclaimed he, &#8216;and Mahomet is his prophet! It has been foretold
		by the ambassador of God, that his law should extend to the ultimate
		parts of the west, and be carried by the sword into new and unknown
		regions. Behold, another land is opened for the triumphs of the
		faithful! It is the will of Allah, and be his sovereign will obeyed!&#8217;
		So the Caliph sent missives to Muza, authorizing him to undertake the
		conquest.</p>

		<p>Upon this there was a great stir of preparation; and numerous vessels
		were assembled and equipped at Tangier, to convey the invading army
		across the Straits. Twelve thousand men were chosen for this expedition:
		most of them light Arabian troops, seasoned in warfare, and fitted
		for hardy and rapid enterprise. Among them were many horsemen,
		mounted on fleet Arabian steeds. The whole was put under the command
		of the veteran, Taric el Tuerto, or the one-eyed, in whom Muza
		reposed implicit confidence, as in a second self. Taric accepted the
		command with joy: his martial fire was roused at the idea of having
		such an army under his sole command, and such a country to overrun;
		and he secretly determined never to return unless victorious.</p>

		<p>He chose a dark night to convey his troops across the Straits of Hercules;
		and, by break of day they began to disembark at Tarifa, before
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page330" name="page330"></a>330</span>the country had time to take the alarm. A few Christians hastily assembled
		from the neighborhood and opposed their landing, but were
		easily put to flight. Taric stood on the sea-side, and watched until the
		last squadron had landed; and all the horses, armour, and munitions of
		war were brought on shore: he then gave orders to set fire to the ships.
		The Moslems were struck with terror when they beheld their fleet
		wrapped in flames and smoke, and sinking beneath the waves. &#8216;How
		shall we escape,&#8217; exclaimed they, &#8216;if the fortune of war should be
		against us?&#8217; &#8216;There is no escape for the coward!&#8217; cried Taric: &#8216;the
		brave man thinks of none: your only chance is victory.&#8217; &#8216;But how,
		without ships, shall we ever return to our homes?&#8217; &#8216;Your home,&#8217; replied
		Taric, &#8216;is before you; but you must win it with your swords.&#8217;</p>

		<p>While Taric was yet talking with his followers, says one of the
		ancient chroniclers, a Christian female was described, waving a white
		pennon on a reed, in signal of peace. On being brought into the presence
		of Taric she prostrated herself before him. &#8216;Senior,&#8217; said she,
		&#8216;I am an ancient woman; and it is now full sixty years, past and gone,
		since, as I was keeping vigils one winter&#8217;s night by the fireside, I heard
		my father, who was an exceeding old man, read a prophecy, said to
		have been written by a holy friar; and this was the purport of the
		prophecy: that a time would arrive when our country would be invaded
		and conquered by a people from Africa, of a strange garb, a strange
		tongue, and a strange religion. They were to be led by a strong and
		valiant captain, who would be known by these signs: on his right
		shoulder he would have a hairy mole, and his right arm would be much
		longer than the left; and of such length as to enable him to cover his
		knee with his hand without bending his body.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Taric listened to the old beldame with grave attention; and, when she
		had concluded, he laid bare his shoulder, and lo! there was the mole as
		it had been described; his right arm, also, was, in verity, found to exceed
		the other in length, though not to the degree that had been mentioned.
		Upon this the Arab host shouted for joy, and felt assured of
		conquest.</p>

		<p>The discreet Antonio Agapida, though he records this circumstance
		as it is set down in ancient chronicle, yet withholds his belief from the
		pretended prophecy, considering the whole a cunning device of Taric
		to increase the courage of his troops. &#8216;Doubtless,&#8217; says he, &#8216;there
		was a collusion between this ancient sybil and the crafty son of Ishmael;
		for these infidel leaders were full of damnable inventions, to work upon
		the superstitious fancies of their followers, and to inspire them with a
		blind confidence in the success of their arms.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Be this as it may, the veteran Taric took advantage of the excitement
		of his soldiery, and led them forward to gain possession of a stronghold,
		which was, in a manner, the key to all the adjacent country. This was
		a lofty mountain, or promontory, almost surrounded by the sea; and
		connected with the mainland by a narrow isthmus. It was called the
		rock of Calpe, and, like the opposite rock of Ceuta, commanded the entrance
		to the Mediterranean Sea. Here, in old times, Hercules had set
		up one of his pillars, and the city of Heraclea had been built.</p>

		<p>As Taric advanced against this promontory, he was opposed by a
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page331" name="page331"></a>331</span>hasty levy of the Christians, who had assembled under the banner of
		a Gothic noble of great power and importance, whose domains lay
		along the mountainous coast of the Mediterranean. The name of this
		Christian cavalier was Theodomir, but he has universally been called
		Tadmir by the Arabian historians; and is renowned as being the first
		commander that made any stand against the inroad of the Moslems.
		He was about forty years of age; hardy, prompt, and sagacious; and
		had all the Gothic nobles been equally vigilant and shrewd in their defence,
		the banner of Islam would never have triumphed over the land.</p>

		<p>Theodomir had but seventeen hundred men under his command, and
		these but rudely armed; yet he made a resolute stand against the army
		of Taric, and defended the pass to the promontory with great valor. He
		was, at length, obliged to retreat; and Taric advanced, and planted his
		standard on the rock of Calpe, and fortified it as his stronghold, and as
		the means of securing an entrance into the land. To commemorate his
		first victory, he changed the name of the promontory, and called it
		Gibel Taric, or the mountain of Taric; but, in process of time, the
		name has gradually been altered to Gibraltar.</p>

		<p>In the mean time, the patriotic chieftain, Theodomir, having collected
		his routed forces, encamped with them on the skirts of the mountains,
		and summoned the country round to join his standard. He sent off missives,
		in all speed, to the king; imparting, in brief and blunt terms,
		the news of the invasion, and craving assistance with equal frankness.
		&#8216;Senior,&#8217; said he, in his letter, &#8216;the legions of Africa are upon us, but
		whether they come from heaven or earth I know not. They seem to
		have fallen from the clouds, for they have no ships. We have been
		taken by surprise, overpowered by numbers, and obliged to retreat;
		and they have fortified themselves in our territory. Send us aid, senior,
		with instant speed; or, rather, come yourself to our assistance.&#8217;</p>

		<p>When Don Roderick heard that legions of turbaned troops had poured
		into the land from Africa, he called to mind the visions and predictions
		of the necromantic tower, and great fear came upon him. But, though
		sunk from his former hardihood and virtue, though enervated by indulgence,
		and degraded in spirit by a consciousness of crime, he was resolute
		of soul, and roused himself to meet the coming danger. He
		summoned a hasty levy of horse and foot, amounting to forty thousand;
		but now were felt the effects of the crafty council of Count Julian, for
		the best of the horses and armour intended for the public service had
		been sent into Africa, and were really in possession of the traitors.
		Many nobles, it is true, took the field with the sumptuous array with
		which they had been accustomed to appear at tournaments and jousts;
		but most of their vassals were destitute of weapons, and cased in cuirasses
		of leather, or suits of armor almost consumed by rust. They
		were without discipline or animation; and their horses, like themselves
		pampered by slothful peace, were little fitted to bear the heat, the dust,
		and toil, of long campaigns.</p>

		<p>This army Don Roderick put under the command of his kinsman
		Ataulpho, a prince of the royal blood of the Goths, and of a noble and
		generous nature; and he ordered him to march with all speed to meet
		the foe, and to recruit his forces on the way with the troops of Theodomir.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page332" name="page332"></a>332</span>In the mean time, Taric el Tuerto had received large re-inforcements
		from Africa, and the adherents of Count Julian, and all those discontented
		with the sway of Don Roderick, had flocked to his standard; for
		many were deceived by the representations of Count Julian, and thought
		that the Arabs had come to aid him in placing the sons of Witiza upon
		the throne. Guided by the count, the troops of Taric penetrated into
		various parts of the country, and laid waste the land; bringing back
		loads of spoil to their stronghold at the rock of Calpe.</p>

		<p>The prince Ataulpho marched with his army through Andalusia, and
		was joined by Theodomir with his troops; he met with various detachments
		of the enemy foraging the country, and had several bloody skirmishes;
		but he succeeded in driving them before him, and they retreated
		to the rock of Calpe, where Taric lay gathered up with the main body
		of his army.</p>

		<p>The prince encamped not far from the bay which spreads itself out
		before the promontory. In the evening he despatched the veteran Theodomir,
		with a trumpet, to demand a parley of the Arab chieftain, who
		received the envoy in his tent, surrounded by his captains. Theodomir
		was frank and abrupt in speech, for the most of his life had been passed
		far from courts. He delivered, in round terms, the message of the
		Prince Ataulpho; upbraiding the Arab general with his wanton invasion
		of the land, and summoning him to surrender his army, or to expect no
		mercy.</p>

		<p>The single eye of Taric el Tuerto glowed like a coal of fire at this
		message. &#8216;Tell your commander,&#8217; replied he, &#8216;that I have crossed the
		strait to conquer Spain, nor will I return until I have accomplished my
		purpose. Tell him I have men skilled in war, and armed in proof,
		with whose aid I trust soon to give a good account of his rabble host.&#8217;</p>

		<p>A murmur of applause passed through the assemblage of Moslem
		captains. Theodomir glanced on them a look of defiance, but his eye
		rested on a renegado Christian, one of his own ancient comrades, and
		a relation of Count Julian. &#8216;As to you, Don Greybeard,&#8217; said he,
		&#8216;you who turn apostate in your declining age, I here pronounce you a
		traitor to your God, your king, and country; and stand ready to prove
		it this instant upon your body, if field be granted me.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The traitor knight was stung with rage at these words, for truth rendered
		them piercing to the heart. He would have immediately answered
		to the challenge, but Taric forbade it, and ordered that the Christian envoy
		should be conducted from the camp. &#8216;&#8217;Tis well,&#8217; replied Theodomir;
		&#8216;God will give me the field which you deny. Let yon hoary
		apostate look to himself to-morrow in the battle, for I pledge myself to
		use my lance upon no other foe until it has shed his blood upon the native
		soil he has betrayed.&#8217; So saying, he left the camp; nor could the
		Moslem chieftains help admiring the honest indignation of this patriot
		knight, while they secretly despised his renegado adversary.</p>

		<p>The ancient Moorish chroniclers relate many awful portents, and
		strange and mysterious visions, which appeared to the commanders of
		either army during this anxious night. Certainly it was a night of
		fearful suspense, and Moslem and Christian looked forward with doubt
		to the fortune of the coming day. The Spanish sentinel walked his pensive
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page333" name="page333"></a>333</span>round, listening occasionally to the vague sounds from the distant
		rock of Calpe, and eyeing it as the mariner eyes the thunder cloud,
		pregnant with terror and destruction. The Arabs, too, from their lofty
		cliffs beheld the numerous camp-fires of the Christians gradually lighted
		up, and saw that they were a powerful host; at the same time the night
		breeze brought to their ears the sullen roar of the sea which separated
		them from Africa. When they considered their perilous situation, an
		army on one side, with a whole nation aroused to re-enforce it, and on
		the other an impassable sea, the spirits of many of the warriors were cast
		down, and they repented the day when they had ventured into this hostile
		land.</p>

		<p>Taric marked their despondency, but said nothing. Scarce had the
		first streak of morning light trembled along the sea, however, when he
		summoned his principal warriors to his tent. &#8216;Be of good cheer,&#8217; said
		he: &#8216;Allah is with us, and has sent his prophet to give assurance of his
		aid. Scarce had I retired to my tent last night, when a man of a majestic
		and venerable presence stood before me. He was taller by a palm
		than the ordinary race of men; his flowing beard was of a golden hue,
		and his eyes were so bright that they seemed to send forth flashes of
		fire. I have heard the Emir Bahamet, and other ancient men, describe
		the prophet, whom they had seen many times while on earth, and such
		was his form and lineament. &#8216;Fear nothing, O Taric, from the morrow,&#8217;
		said he, &#8216;I will be with thee in the fight. Strike boldly, then,
		and conquer. Those of thy followers who survive the battle will have
		this land for an inheritance; for those who fall, a mansion in paradise
		is prepared, and immortal houris await their coming.&#8217; He spake and
		vanished; I heard a strain of celestial melody, and my tent was filled
		with the odors of Arabia the Happy.&#8217; &#8216;Such,&#8217; says the Spanish chroniclers,
		&#8216;was another of the arts by which this arch son of Ishmael
		sought to animate the hearts of his followers;&#8217; and the pretended vision
		had been recorded by the Arabian writers as a veritable occurrence.
		Marvellous, indeed, was the effect produced by it upon the infidel soldiery,
		who now cried out with eagerness to be led against the foe.</p>

		<p>The gray summits of the rock of Calpe brightened with the first rays
		of morning, as the Christian army issued forth from its encampment.
		The Prince Ataulpho rode from squadron to squadron, animating his
		soldiers for the battle. &#8216;Never should we sheath our swords,&#8217; said he,
		&#8216;while these infidels have a footing in the land. They are pent up
		within yon rocky mountain, we must assail them in their rugged hole.
		We have a long day before us: let not the setting sun shine upon one
		of their host, who is not a fugitive, a captive, or a corpse.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The words of the prince were received with shouts, and the army
		moved toward the promontory. As they advanced, they heard the clash
		of cymbals and the bray of trumpets, and the rocky bosom of the mountain
		glittered with helms and spears and scimetars; for the Arabs, inspired
		with fresh confidence by the words of Taric, were sallying forth,
		with flaunting banners, to the combat.</p>

		<p>The gaunt Arab chieftain stood upon a rock as his troops marched
		by; his buckler was at his back, and he brandished in his hand a
		double-pointed spear. Calling upon the several leaders by their names,
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page334" name="page334"></a>334</span>he exhorted them to direct their attacks against the Christian captains,
		and especially against Ataulpho; &#8216;for the chiefs being slain,&#8217; said he,
		&#8216;their followers will vanish from before us like the morning mist.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The Gothic nobles were easily to be distinguished by the splendor of
		their arms; but the Prince Ataulpho was conspicuous above all the rest
		for the youthful grace and majesty of his appearance, and the bravery
		of his array. He was mounted on a superb Andalusian charger, richly
		caparisoned with crimson velvet, embroidered with gold. His surcoat
		was of like color and adornment, and the plumes that waved above his
		burnished helmet were of the purest white. Ten mounted pages, magnificently
		attired, followed him to the field, but their duty was not so
		much to fight as to attend upon their lord, and to furnish him with steed
		or weapon.</p>

		<p>The Christian troops, though irregular and undisciplined, were full
		of native courage; for the old warrior spirit of their Gothic sires still
		glowed in their bosoms. There were two battalions of infantry, but
		Ataulpho stationed them in the rear; &#8216;for God forbid,&#8217; said he, &#8216;that
		foot soldiers should have the place of honor in the battle, when I have
		so many valiant cavaliers.&#8217; As the armies drew nigh to each other,
		however, it was discovered that the advance of the Arabs was composed
		of infantry. Upon this the cavaliers checked their steeds, and requested
		that the foot soldiery might advance and disperse this losel crew, holding
		it beneath their dignity to contend with pedestrian foes. The prince,
		however, commanded them to charge; upon which, putting spurs to
		their steeds, they rushed upon the foe.</p>

		<p>The Arabs stood the shock manfully, receiving the horses upon the
		points of their lances; many of the riders were shot down with bolts
		from cross-bows, or stabbed with the poniards of the Moslems. The
		cavaliers succeeded, however, in breaking into the midst of the battalion
		and throwing it into confusion, cutting down some with their swords,
		transpiercing others with their spears, and trampling many under the
		hoofs of their horses. At this moment, they were attacked by a band
		of Spanish horsemen, the recreant partisans of Count Julian. Their
		assault bore hard upon their countrymen, who were disordered by the
		contest with the foot soldiers, and many a loyal Christian knight fell
		beneath the sword of an unnatural foe.</p>

		<p>The foremost among these recreant warriors was the renegado cavalier
		whom Theodomir had challenged in the tent of Taric. He dealt
		his blows about him with a powerful arm and with malignant fury, for
		nothing is more deadly than the hatred of an apostate. In the midst of
		his career he was espied by the hardy Theodomir, who came spurring
		to the encounter: &#8216;Traitor,&#8217; cried he, &#8216;I have kept my vow. This lance
		has been held sacred from all other foes to make a passage for thy perjured
		soul.&#8217; The renegado had been renowned for prowess before he
		became a traitor to his country, but guilt will sap the courage of the
		stoutest heart. When he beheld Theodomir rushing upon him, he
		would have turned and fled; pride alone withheld him; and, though
		an admirable master of defence, he lost all skill to ward the attack of
		his adversary. At the first assault the lance of Theodomir pierced him
		through and through; he fell to the earth, gnashed his teeth as he rolled
		in the dust, but yielded his breath without uttering a word.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page335" name="page335"></a>335</span>The battle now became general, and lasted throughout the morning
		with varying success. The stratagem of Taric, however, began to
		produce its effect. The Christian leaders and most conspicuous cavaliers
		were singled out, and severally assailed by overpowering numbers.
		They fought desperately, and performed miracles of prowess; but fell,
		one by one, beneath a thousand wounds. Still the battle lingered on
		throughout a great part of the day; and as the declining sun shone
		through the clouds of dust, it seemed as if the conflicting hosts were
		wrapped in smoke and fire.</p>

		<p>The Prince Ataulpho saw that the fortune of battle was against him.
		He rode about the field calling out the names of the bravest of his
		knights, but few answered to his call; the rest lay mangled on the field.
		With this handful of warriors he endeavored to retrieve the day, when
		he was assailed by Tenderos, a partisan of Count Julian, at the head
		of a body of recreant Christians. At sight of this new adversary, fire
		flashed from the eyes of the prince, for Tenderos had been brought up
		in his father&#8217;s palace. &#8216;Well dost thou, traitor!&#8217; cried he, &#8216;to attack
		the son of thy lord, who gave thee bread; thou, who hast betrayed thy
		country and thy God!&#8217;</p>

		<p>So saying, he seized a lance from one of his pages, and charged
		furiously upon the apostate; but Tenderos met him in mid career, and
		the lance of the prince was shivered upon his shield. Ataulpho then
		grasped his mace, which hung at his saddle bow, and a doubtful fight
		ensued. Tenderos was powerful of frame and superior in the use of
		his weapons, but the curse of treason seemed to paralyze his arm. He
		wounded Ataulpho slightly between the greaves of his armor, but the
		prince dealt a blow with his mace that crushed through helm and skull,
		and reached the brains; and Tenderos fell dead to the earth, his armor
		rattling as he fell.</p>

		<p>At the same moment a javelin, hurled by an Arab, transpierced the
		horse of Ataulpho, which sunk beneath him. The prince seized the
		reins of the steed of Tenderos; but the faithful animal, as though he
		knew him to be the foe of his late lord, reared and plunged, and refused
		to let him mount. The prince, however, used him as a shield to ward
		off the press of foes: while, with his sword, he defended himself against
		those in front of him. Taric ben Zeyad arrived at the scene of conflict,
		and paused, for a moment, in admiration of the surpassing prowess of
		the prince: recollecting, however, that his fall would be a death-blow
		to his army, he spurred upon him, and wounded him severely with his
		scimetar. Before he could repeat his blow, Theodomir led up a body
		of Christian cavaliers to the rescue, and Taric was parted from his prey
		by the tumult of the fight. The prince sank to the earth, covered with
		wounds, and exhausted by the loss of blood. A faithful page drew him
		from under the hoofs of the horses, and, aided by a veteran soldier, an
		ancient vassal of Ataulpho, conveyed him to a short distance from the
		field of battle, by the side of a small stream that gushed out from among
		rocks. They staunched the blood that flowed from his wounds, and
		washed the dust from his face, and laid him beside the fountain. The
		page sat at his head, and supported it on his knees; and the veteran
		stood at his feet, with his brow bent, and his eyes full of sorrow. The
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page336" name="page336"></a>336</span>prince gradually revived, and opened his eyes. &#8216;How fares the battle?&#8217;
		said he. &#8216;The struggle is hard,&#8217; replied the soldier, &#8216;but the day may
		yet be ours.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The prince felt that the hour of his death was at hand, and ordered
		that they should aid him to rise upon his knees. They supported him
		between them, and he prayed fervently for a short time, when, finding
		his strength declining, he beckoned the veteran to sit down beside him
		on the rock. Continuing to kneel, he confessed himself to that ancient
		soldier; having no priest or friar to perform that office in this hour of
		extremity. When he had so done, he sunk again upon the earth, and
		pressed it with his lips, as if he would take a fond farewell of his beloved
		country. The page would then have raised his head, but found
		that his lord had yielded up the ghost.</p>

		<p>A number of Arab warriors, who came to the fountain to slake their
		thirst, cut off the head of the prince and bore it in triumph to Taric,
		crying, &#8216;Behold the head of the Christian leader!&#8217; Taric immediately
		ordered that the head should be put upon the end of a lance, together
		with the surcoat of the prince, and borne about the field of battle, with
		the sound of trumpets, atabels, and cymbals.</p>

		<p>When the Christians beheld the surcoat, and knew the features of the
		prince, they were struck with horror, and heart and hand failed them.
		Theodomir endeavored in vain to rally them; they threw by their
		weapons and fled; and they continued to fly, and the enemy to pursue
		and slay them, until the darkness of the night. The Moslems then returned,
		and plundered the Christian camp, where they found abundant
		spoil.</p>

		upon purchasing an estate in the country, upon which he might
		retire and enjoy the residue of life in unostentatious ease and quiet.
		He was a man of elegant tastes and fond of antiquarian pursuits. This
		latter predilection induced him, in his various summer journeyings in
		England, to select from among those old inns or taverns which are invariably
		to be met with in every ancient borough or market-town, the most
		respectable one, as the place at which he would put up; and when &#8216;mine
		host&#8217; gave token of being a gentleman, his companionship would generally
		be requested, through a card by the waiter, bearing the compliments
		of the guest, with a hope that it might be convenient for the landlord to
		favor him with his company over a bottle of wine. This was the almost
		invariable plan adopted, when he was unaccompanied with his &#8216;better
		half.&#8217; It will readily be conceived that in these tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte gossipings, a
		great fund of anecdote and legendary tales had been gleaned, which
		were made subservient to the entertainment of friends when assembled
		around the social board. It is from this fund of gossip to which I
		have so often listened, that I propose to select one which, owing to my
		close relationship to the stout gentleman, has been to me a source of no
		little interest, even as a &#8216;thrice-told tale.&#8217; The incident occurred at the
		time when he was in search of the estate to which I have alluded in the
		commencement of this sketch.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page339" name="page339"></a>339</span>It was late in the evening, in the spring of the year, when he arrived
		at the destined stopping-place for the night, which if I remember rightly
		was the ancient borough of St. Albans. Here he selected an inn according
		to his usual taste; an old rambling disjointed patch-work piece of
		architecture, the gradual accumulation of many preceding generations,
		where might be seen rude carvings of grinning nondescript monsters
		supporting the projecting stories as they each hung over the side-walk;
		large and small casement windows, with square mullions and gothic arches,
		and many a gabled roof fronting on the street, where at their junction
		the continuous gutters projected in the form of long pipes, which
		in rainy weather discharged cataracts of water, deluging the unfortunate
		pedestrian who should unwittingly prefer the side-walk to the rough
		paved road. In the centre of this pile of buildings was the gate-way,
		large enough to admit coaches with outside passengers; and under its
		ample, shadowy shelter would be found the entrance to the building
		itself. On one side was the door to the tap-room, used by post-boys,
		servants, and the like class, while on the opposite side the glazed door
		led to the coffee-room and the more respectable apartments. Here Boniface
		would present himself whenever a carriage drove up, to give a
		hearty welcome to his guests. The interior, in accordance with the
		outside, was composed of low, spacious rooms, wainscoated in oaken
		pannels, blackened with age, but brightly polished by continued rubbings.
		The furniture was of a past century; the floors worm-eaten but
		of scrupulous cleanliness, their centres covered with modern or perchance
		Turkish carpets. The mullioned windows with their appropriate
		leaden-lozenged casements, glazed with glass of various shades of
		green, were ornamented with curtains, not hung for show but intended
		to be used nightly.</p>

		<p>Into one of these rooms our elderly gentleman was ceremoniously
		shown by the obsequious waiter; and here, after the hearty meal was
		ended and the newspaper run through, the evening was spent, as the
		reader will perhaps anticipate, in company with &#8216;mine host.&#8217; It was
		spring, as I have before said; cold and cheerless without, but within a
		bright blazing fire, and a table upon which sparkled generous wine, &#8216;that
		maketh glad the heart of man,&#8217; gave earnest of comfortable quarters.
		You may fancy the stout gentleman and his companion honest Boniface,
		no shadow, each seated in arm chairs of creditable proportions, whiling
		away the evening hour with many a tale; a fragment of one of which
		we will now just touch upon.</p>

		<p>&#8216;And you really think the tile which you have dug up from below the
		foundation in the cellar, to be of the date of Julius CÃ¦sar; and infer
		from it that a roof has sheltered this spot for two thousand years? It is
		a hallowed thought to reflect upon the crowd of spirits which must hover
		over and around us, if we suppose, as some do, that when we leave this
		tabernacle of clay, we shall continue to linger in the midst of our old
		haunts; and that these spirits are the unseen and unfelt witnesses of our
		every act. It may be mere fancy, but I am inclined to think there is
		more truth in the thought than cold philosophy is willing to admit.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Then, Sir, you are a believer in ghosts?&#8217; observed Boniface.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Why, no; I cannot say truly that I am, though I have oftentimes
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page340" name="page340"></a>340</span>longed to make an acquaintance with one. By the way, I should think
		this building of nooks and corners was admirably adapted for the carrying
		out some marvel of the sort. Pray, is there not some hobgoblin or
		merry sprite playing his antics about your premises, my worthy host?&#8217;</p>

		<p>Hereupon Boniface looked doubtingly, and feeling his way before
		committing himself, he at last admitted that &#8216;there was some idle story
		of the kind, but for his part, he put no faith in such silly things.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Well, of course,&#8217; said his guest, &#8216;it must be some particular room
		that is thus honored?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Well?&#8217; was the deferential rejoinder, in a tone denoting a wish to
		hear the deduction.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Then, if it is a bed-chamber, snug and comfortable, do me the favor
		to apportion it to me for the night.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Most certainly, if you are serious,&#8217; rejoined Boniface; &#8216;it shall be
		made ready immediately; but I assure you that my patrons seldom give
		it the preference.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Hereupon the bell was rung, and the waiter presenting himself, was
		requested to direct the chamber-maid to prepare the large room, and to
		see that the bed was well aired, and to tell Boots to take the gentleman&#8217;s
		trunk up, to kindle a fire, and to see that every thing was tidy.</p>

		<p>The evening was thus whiled away until the hour of eleven had arrived,
		when the great stillness of the house betokened the time for retiring.
		Accordingly, the chamber-maid was summoned, and with a candle
		in each hand, she led the way up a wide stair-case, graced with
		twisted bannisters and of easy ascent, terminating on a long corridor,
		the floor full of uncertain undulations, running the entire length of the
		building. At the end was a door, which upon opening, discovered a
		room of large proportions, with a low ceiling divided into square compartments.
		Here our traveller was no sooner installed and left alone,
		than he locked the door; then with candle in hand he began to examine
		each crack and cranny, but could find nothing suspicious. There were
		few things in it worthy of note, excepting a large bed with drawn curtains
		of dazzling whiteness; a most ample hearth, on which was blazing
		a bundle of dry faggots, sending forth a warm, cheerful light into the
		room, more powerful than both the candles. This huge fire-place, with
		its concomitant ornament, a profusely-carved mantel-piece of the usual
		time-stained oak, was at least five feet high, and more than two feet
		broad; its ingenious workmanship occupied his attention, and kept him
		for some time engaged in curious admiration of its exquisite quaintness.
		The other furniture consisted of chairs, a chest-of-drawers, and a table,
		all the work of a former age. An easy chair was placed in the middle
		of the room, in which the stout gentleman composed himself luxuriously
		for a short time. The room however was too large to be easily warmed,
		and he soon abandoned it for the bed, but not before he had raked the
		remaining brands together and extinguished the candles. Not feeling
		at once the influence of the drowsy god, he abandoned himself to many
		fanciful speculations. He marvelled why it was that the concurrence
		of all ages and nations, enlightened or ignorant, savage or civilized,
		should have so uniformly led to the belief in good and evil spirits wandering
		at large on the earth, not subject to the laws of matter, save in
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page341" name="page341"></a>341</span>the sensation of sight and hearing. The creditable phalanx of names
		of distinguished persons who had placed their veracity on the side of
		believers, as having themselves been visited by the inhabitants of the
		other world, was opposed by his own experience; for although he had
		frequently thought he had been so honored, yet upon investigating the
		cause, he had invariably found it to be a mere delusion.</p>

		<p>It was not long however that he was suffered thus to enjoy himself; for
		hearing a slight noise near the fire-place, he turned his head, and saw
		a deformed, dwarfish body emerge from the shadowy part of the room,
		proceed stealthily toward the fire, over which he rubbed his thin, attenuated
		hands, and then placing them under their opposite arms, he hugged
		himself in evident comfort. The fire had by this time so far dwindled
		away as to be only a handful of smouldering embers, which cast but
		an exceedingly feeble and uncertain light, sufficient only to reveal the
		general outline of the pigmy spectre. The old gentleman, with strained
		eyes, attentively observed his motions, till from very weariness, caused
		by looking through a light so dim, he began to doubt whether he saw
		truly: he reasoned with himself, but with no satisfactory result; till at
		last, desirous of &#8216;making assurance doubly sure,&#8217; he gently enlarged
		his look-out in the slightly-opened curtains in order that he might more
		attentively observe the room; but all was darkness, save in the immediate
		vicinity of the fire. The removal of the curtain however had
		made a rustling noise, which had given the alarm to the spectre-imp,
		who immediately vanished into the gloom of the apartment on the side
		of the fire-place.</p>

		<p>This was no sooner observed by the wide-awake old gentleman, than
		he jumped out of bed, resolved to give chase; but although stout gentlemen
		are generally no-wise active, not a second had elapsed before he
		reached the hearth, and scattering the embers in order to obtain more
		light, he looked carefully around, but no trace of the phantom could be
		seen. A few seconds more, and one of the candles was lighted, when
		the room was again subjected to a more rigid scrutiny; but all to no
		purpose; for the door remained locked, and the closet-doors were equally
		secure; nothing was under the bed, nor behind the table; the easy-chair
		could afford no shelter; in the front of every lower tier of pannels
		was some article of furniture, which effectually prevented their
		being used suddenly; beside, how could the furniture be reÃ¤djusted?
		The upper ones were too high to be at all likely to afford the means of
		such quick concealment. Hence he was completely mystified, amazed,
		perplexed. His mental powers were in a whirl; until at length he became
		perfectly bewildered, and concluded that he had been dreaming,
		or had been taking a short trot on a night-mare; and with this latter
		idea he returned, shivering like an ague, to his cold bed. The candle
		was now suffered to burn, and pillowing his head high, so as to see all
		around, the curtains having been previously withdrawn, he determined
		to keep vigilant watch. At length becoming composed and comfortably
		warm, he distinctly recalled the whole train of thought which had preceded
		the appearance of the strange phantom. Finally, he concluded
		that if it were all a dream, an illusion, never was a dream or an illusion
		so like reality. He must from henceforth doubt the evidence of his
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page342" name="page342"></a>342</span>senses. Thus he reasoned and doubted, doubted and reasoned, until
		the candle&#8217;s light and all around had faded into dimness. Slumber
		gradually usurped its sway, and he slept till late next morning. On
		awaking, the whole affair was too vividly remembered, for him to settle
		down into a belief that he had dreamed. He was determined to satisfy
		himself. It was not long before his feet were in his slippers; and
		throwing on his dressing-gown, he went the round of another and still
		another examination, with no more satisfactory result than before; until
		at last, tired with conjecture, he dismissed it from his mind, and completed
		his toilet.</p>

		<p>At the breakfast-table, he simply remarked, in reply to the inquiry
		if he had slept well, that he had dreamed the room was haunted by a
		dwarfish ghost, but he pretended to believe that it was only a dream.</p>

		<p>&#8216;There!&#8217; rejoined the auditor; &#8216;<em>others</em> have dreamed the same thing!&#8217;</p>

		<p>The discussion of the creature-comforts on the table was too interesting
		to permit a discussion of discomforts, and inquiry was silenced.</p>

		<p>The morning sun was shining brightly, tempting the healthful to
		enjoy his cheerful beams. It was not long therefore before our traveller
		was seen taking the direction to the old abbey-church. The sight of
		such ancient buildings was always keenly relished by him, by reason of
		his antiquarian tastes; but in this instance, it led to the clearing up of
		the last night&#8217;s mystery; for in his rambles around this immense pile
		of architecture, he literally &#8216;stumbled upon&#8217; an old friend, who was
		connected with the parish affairs, and was consequently enabled to give
		much interest to his descriptions of the place. The last night&#8217;s events
		were of course not forgotten; in fact it was all circumstantially detailed,
		even to a minute description of the dwarf.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Well, well,&#8217; was the reply, &#8216;I think I can show you the living facsimile
		of your fancied dream; the only thing which puzzles me is to
		account for his entrance to your chamber. Let us step into the house
		adjoining the inn, and you shall judge for yourself.&#8217;</p>

		<p>They accordingly adjourned to the place indicated; and there the
		very imp himself was actually felt and handled! It required some
		coaxing, not unmixed with threats, before he could be prevailed upon to
		unfold the secrets of his prison-house, but they were finally extorted.
		It seemed, that up stairs, on a level with the haunted chamber, was a
		closet, immediately back of the fire-place with the carved oaken mantelpiece,
		once side of which, it will be remembered, was at least two feet
		wide; and its curious carvings were so adroitly made as to conceal the
		cracks of that part which opened as a door: this, if even left ajar,
		would still be in shadow from the fire on the hearth, and consequently
		an instant of time was only necessary for the person near by to make
		his escape, and to effectually conceal the mode by which it was accomplished.
		The brick jam was of course hollow, and led to the back of
		the closet in the next house; which, being pannelled all around, and
		situated against a solid wall, as was supposed, had eluded discovery
		after the builders had passed away. How this misshapen piece of humanity
		had re-discovered it, I never knew; but I fancy that, accidentally
		being in the closet at the time when there had been a noise made
		in the fire-place, either from kindling a fire or cleaning it; and hearing
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page343" name="page343"></a>343</span>this noise distinctly, might have suggested to him to try the back;
		which, opening inside of the secret passage, might have been forced
		from its spring-catch; while the holes in the carved work of the mantel
		enabled him to see if any one was in the room; and thus prevent an
		intrusion which would lead to his detection.</p>

				<h3 class="subtitle">I.</h3>
				<p><span class="first_word">I remember</span> roaming lonely by the mournful forest streams,</p>
				<p>The loveliness and melody of childhood&#8217;s happy dreams;</p>
				<p>Pale flowers, the vermeil-tinted, lightly fanned by vernal breeze,</p>
				<p>Whose fitful breath went sighingly among the solemn trees;</p>
				<p>Sunny streamlets, gushing clearly in their fresh and tameless glee,</p>
				<p>Sparkling onward, ever onward, toward a golden summer sea.</p>
				<p>Fairy isles of green were sleeping on its softly-heaving breast,</p>
				<p>Where the chime of waves low rippling forever lulled to rest.</p>
				<p>The slanting sunbeams wandered through each quiet vale and dell,</p>
				<p>Shaded glen, and gray old cavern, where the foamy cascade fell;</p>
				<p>And birds, the starry-wing&#8217;d, flitting through the rich perfume,</p>
				<p>Filled with their gladsome minstrelsy the depths of leafy gloom.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="stanza">
				<h3 class="subtitle">II.</h3>
				<p>I remember, I remember, in my musings sad and lone,</p>
				<p>The beauty and the brightness, that have vanished, and are gone,</p>
				<p>Rosy clouds at eve reposing in the crimson-curtained west,</p>
				<p>Mocking with their tranquil splendor the human heart&#8217;s unrest.</p>
				<p>They are gliding through my visions, as they used to do of yore,</p>
				<p>Yet the gentle thoughts they wakened, shall <em>they</em> come back no more?</p>
				<p>Oh! many an hour I lingered to watch their gorgeous dyes</p>
				<p>In soft and shadowy outlines against the purple skies;</p>
				<p>Through their regal halls, air-woven, the parting radiance streamed,</p>
				<p>Ever varying like the opal&#8217;s hue: and often have I deemed</p>
				<p>They were come with tender message, in the holy hush of even,</p>
				<p>From the Loved of years departed, spirit-guardians in Heaven!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="stanza">
				<h3 class="subtitle">III.</h3>
				<p>To my memory come back darkly in the stilly midnight hour,</p>
				<p>Dim and faded now, the pictures of Life&#8217;s early glow and power,</p>
				<p>When the world was arched with halos of hopes unmixed with fears,</p>
				<p>And I marvelled they should tell me but of sorrowing and tears!</p>
				<p>When my spirit loved to revel in its palaces of dreams,</p>
				<p>Lit with lightning-flash of fancy, rosy bloom and starry gleams;</p>
				<p>Listening to the choral harmonies that filled each lofty dome,</p>
				<p>Like the clear and liquid music in the Nereid&#8217;s azure home.</p>
				<p>And it looked from its proud towers on the Future&#8217;s magic scene,</p>
				<p>Till the Present grew all gladsome with the brightness of its sheen;</p>
				<p>Far off-notes of triumph swelling, floated up from years to come,</p>
				<p>Silver blast of clarion blending with the roll of stormy drum!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="stanza">
				<h3 class="subtitle">IV.</h3>
				<p>I remember, I remember, in my vigils cold and lone,</p>
				<p>Brilliant reveries, burning fantasies, forever fled and gone!</p>
				<p>Stately visions passed before me in the mystic realms of Mind,</p>
				<p>Shapes of glory lightly wafted on the balmy summer wind;</p>
				<p>Forms of pale and pensive loveliness, with eyes like pensile stars,</p>
				<p>Such as never yet were beaming &#8217;mid this world&#8217;s discordant jars.</p>
				<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page344" name="page344"></a>344</span>And their whispers wild, unearthly, unutterable, fell</p>
				<p>like a harp-string&#8217;s dying echo, or a fair young spirit&#8217;s knell,</p>
				<p>On my soul amid the shadows of my native forest trees,</p>
				<p>Rustling melancholy, lowly, in the wailing of the breeze,</p>
				<p>Till, unknowing pain or agony, I&#8217;ve wept such blissful tears</p>
				<p>As shall never, never flow again &#8217;mid darker later years!</p>

				<p>I am dreaming, I am dreaming of the bright ones that are gone,</p>
				<p>The gifted and the beautiful, from Time&#8217;s sad wasting flown,</p>
				<p>Of those beings pure and gentle, like the passing glow of even,</p>
				<p>Sent to teach us of a better, higher heritage in Heaven!</p>
				<p>Sweet they were as first wild flowers that herald coming spring,</p>
				<p>Or a mellow gleam of sunset through the storm-cloud&#8217;s raven wing.</p>
				<p>Fragile as that opening flower, fleeting as that golden ray,</p>
				<p>Like the snow-wreath of the morning, full soon they fled away!</p>
				<p>And fit it is it should be so; their mission here was brief</p>
				<p>&#8217;Mid the blighting and the bitterness of Earth&#8217;s unquiet grief;</p>
				<p>So their hands were meekly folded, and closed their dreamful eyes,</p>

				<p>The piercing eyes of Genius, lit with unearthly fire,</p>
				<p>Seemed to thrill me as I listened to his wild and burning lyre;</p>

		<h2 class="title">A FIRST NIGHT OF RACINE.</h2>
		<h3 class="subtitle">FROM DE JOUY&#8217;S &#8216;HERMITE&#8217; OF THE FOURTH OF JANUARY, EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND TWELVE.</h3>
		<div class="epigram">
			<p class="centered_line">VoilÃ  de vos arrÃªts, Messieurs les Gens de GoÃ»t!</p>
			<p class="source">Prior La Metromaine.</p>
		</div>

		<p><span class="first_word">Every-body</span> has a hobby-horse, as the English say, on which he is
		mounted, even when sneering at the steeds of his neighbors. The wits
		themselves are not exempt from this mental preÃ¶ccupation, which brings
		every taste to bear upon only one point. Some ruin themselves in
		books, some in pictures and statues, others in minerals, shells, or medals.
		The bibliomaniac, the picture-dealer, the naturalist, the numismatist, all
		appear to me equally absurd. I speak of course of those who have the
		collecting mania without the love of science. They play at science as
		we play at cards, and the ridiculous part of the matter is, the perfect
		seriousness with which they do it.</p>

		<p>One of my friends has become infatuated with a taste which is much
		less common; one that he brought back with him from his travels, together
		with albums, mnemonics, and Kant&#8217;s Philosophy. It is a taste
		for autograph letters. It is well known that the English, who are always
		ready to confound what is rare with what is really admirable, are
		very successful in their curiosities of this kind. They collect them at
		a great expense, and employ skilful engravers to reproduce fac-similes
		for second-rate amateurs, whose whole fortune would not suffice for the
		acquisition of the originals.</p>

		<p>Last week I came upon my friend the autographist, just as he was
		receiving a note of Boileau, of only four lines, in which he regrets that
		he cannot dine the next day with a Mr. Le Vasseur. This note, written
		in the most simple style, contained no anecdote, nor curious fact, and
		was only remarkable for a fault in its orthography. So that all the respect
		I have for our great critic did not prevent me from testifying some
		surprise, when I saw my friend pay ten Louis for a paper rag of no
		value at all.</p>

		<p>&#8216;I understand your astonishment,&#8217; he said; &#8216;but to complete a collection,
		no matter of what kind, one must make sacrifices;&#8217; and at the
		same time he placed his precious paper in a <i>carton</i>, labelled &#8216;<i>Age of
		Louis XIV.</i>&#8217; &#8216;You see,&#8217; he continued, pointing to a part of his library
		where several similar cartons were arranged, &#8216;you see the result of my
		collections for some years. I have sixty thousand francs&#8217; worth of autographs
		in that corner.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;For which you cannot get ten from the grocer at the next corner,
		who is probably the only person to whom the rubbish would be of any
		use.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Vandal!&#8217; he exclaimed, with a mixture of indignation and contempt;
		&#8216;you talk like a man whom posterity will never mention. Look at the
		names you have insulted! Look at this letter from Montaigne to BoÃ«tius,
		so illegible that it has never been printed; look at that billet of Henry
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page346" name="page346"></a>346</span>IV. to the Duchesse de Verneuil; and that Sonnet of Malherbe, written
		entirely by Bacon&#8217;s own hand; that letter from Madame de Maintenon
		to Father Le Tellier; that order from the Prince the night before the
		battle of Senef&#8212;&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Even if I were wishing,&#8217; I answered, &#8216;to share your veneration for
		some of these relics which excite so many historical recollections, I
		should not laugh the less at the zeal with which you preserve all that
		waste paper, which has nothing to recommend it. For instance, what is
		this letter worth which I have just taken up? It is signed by a Marquis
		d&#8217;Hernouville, whom no one ever heard of, and directed to a Comte
		de Monchevreuil, who is remembered only for one or two instances of
		gallantry in the field, and for having been, if I am not mistaken, the
		governor of the Duc de Maine.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;You could not have furnished me with a better opportunity of proving
		to you that we always run some risk in assertions upon subjects of
		which we know nothing. Oblige me by reading that letter, and then
		laugh, if you can, at the importance which I attach to similar papers.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Never, I must own, was triumph more complete. Not only did I
		confess, after having perused it, that it was well worthy of the honor of
		the port-folio, but I begged him to let me copy it for publication. I had
		some difficulty in obtaining this favor, which was only granted me in
		exchange of a letter of Hyder Ali Khan to Suffren, which I promised
		to send him.</p>



		<p>This is the letter of the Marquis, which I certify to be in every respect
		a true copy of the original:</p>

		<div class="letter">
			<p class="dateline">&#8216;Paris, the 30 December, 1669.</p>

			<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">I seize</span> the occasion, my dear Comte, afforded me by a cold which
			has kept me some days by the fire-side, to send you news from this part
			of the country. The most important, and what will give you the most
			pleasure is, that M. de Guise has obtained the favor of a cushion at the
			King&#8217;s mass; he did not fail to make use of it on Sunday, and between
			ourselves, with rather too much ostentation. Every one expects wonders
			from the Marquis de Chastet, who has boasted that he will soon
			bring the Algerians to terms, but I have no faith in his predictions.
			The Duc de Vermandois has been raised to the dignity of Admiral.
			Madame de la Valliere received this mark of the royal favor with the
			most perfect indifference. I am quite of your opinion: that woman is
			not in her proper place.</p>

			<p>&#8216;Did your brother write you that we went together to the first representation
			of Britannicus? Some admirers of Racine had praised the
			piece so much to me, that not being able to get a box, I sent my valet at
			ten o&#8217;clock to keep a place for me. I thought that I should never reach
			the HÃ´tel de Bourgogne, although I left my carriage at the corner of the
			Rue Mauconseil: without Chapelle and Mauvillain, who know all the
			actors in Paris, I should never have succeeded in getting a place. Do
			not mistake this eagerness of the public; there was much more malevolence
			than curiosity in it. I paid my respects to Madame de SÃ©vignÃ©
			in her box, where I found Mesdames de Villars, de Coulanges and de
			La Fayette, escorted by the little AbbÃ© de Villars and de Grignau the
			<i>Frondeur</i>. You may imagine what treatment Britannicus received in
			<span class="pagenum"><a id="page347" name="page347"></a>347</span>that box. Madame de SÃ©vignÃ© said the other day at Madame de Villarceau&#8217;s
			that &#8216;Le Racine passerait comme le cafÃ©.&#8217; This speech made
			every one laugh; all agreed that it was as just as it was good. What
			I most like is the presumption of this tragedy student, who undertakes
			to make Romans talk for us after our great, our sublime Corneille; but
			some people think that they can do any thing. I never saw the HÃ´tel
			de Bourgogne so brilliant. Such a fashionable audience deserved a better
			piece. The people in the pit yawned, and those in the boxes went
			to sleep. Vilandry was snoring away in the box of the Commandeur
			de LouvrÃ©. Since he dines at that table, the best kept in Paris, he goes
			to the theatre to digest <i>haciendo la siesta</i>, wakes up when all is over, and
			pronounces the play detestable. I cannot understand what pleasure the
			brave and witty Commandeur can take in the society of a man who
			never opens his mouth but to eat. DesprÃ©aux, (Boileau,) beside whom I
			was sitting, was furious at the coldness of the pit. He protested that it
			was Racine&#8217;s chef d&#8217;Åuvre; that the ancients had never written any
			thing finer; that neither Tacitus nor Corneille had ever produced any
			thing more forcible. He had like to have quarrelled with Subligny, because
			in the scene where Nero hides behind a curtain to listen to Junia,
			he could not restrain a burst of laughter, which was echoed all over the
			house. Perhaps this bad play will furnish him with the materials for
			another &#8216;Folle Querelle,&#8217;<a href="#fn3" class="fnmarker" title="Parody of &#8216;Andromache:&#8217; ..." id="fnm3" name="fnm3">3</a> which will make us laugh as much as the
			first. Ninon and the Prince sided with DesprÃ©aux. They defended the
			ground inch by inch, but without being able to cover the retreat of Britannicus.
			I am curious to know how the little rival of the great Corneille
			will take this failure, for it certainly is one. The worst of the
			business for him is, that every one remarked some very clear and very
			audacious allusions. The King said nothing about them; but yesterday
			at his levee, he countermanded a ballet in which he was to have
			danced at St. Germain. This may put our poet somewhat out of favor
			at court; but what the devil have poets to do there?</p>

			<p>&#8216;Floridor was sublime. You would have sworn that he had wagered
			to make one of the worst parts he overplayed successful. I cannot tell
			you much of the plot of this tragedy. How could I hear it? I sat between
			your brother and the fat Vicomte. Nevertheless you may rely
			on me that it is bad, decidedly bad, whatever the satirist may say about
			it. I am quite of his opinion when he says, &#8216;That a work of that importance
			must be listened to with attention, and that it is unjust to pronounce
			upon a play in the midst of the clamors of theatre-factions, and
			the chattering of that crowd of women who are always eager to display
			themselves at a first representation.&#8217; All this is very true, but not at all
			applicable in this instance. This time Racine is well judged. The
			dÃ©nouement is the most ridiculous I ever heard. Imagine that silly,
			conceited Junia turning vestal, as if Madame de SennÃ¨s were to enter
			the Ursuline Convent. Heaven forbid that I should play the scholar;
			but I have read in MÃ©nage that it required other formalities to take the
			veil in the convent of ladies of the society of Vesta. I forgot the most
			<span class="pagenum"><a id="page348" name="page348"></a>348</span>essential. Your little DesÅuillet played like an angel. I spoke to her
			about you in her box. I think that you had better come and speak about
			it yourself. She is a girl for whom constancy is only the interval that
			separates two fancies.</p>

			<p>&#8216;If you ever get the <i>Nouvelles Ã  la Main</i> where you are, you will
			see Racine handled without gloves. The number which treats of his
			play has not yet appeared; but if Le Clerc does things as he should,
			and remembers the just resentment of d&#8217;Olonne and de CrÃ©qui,<a href="#fn4" class="fnmarker" title="Alluding to an epigram of ..." id="fnm4" name="fnm4">4</a> from
			whom he received two hundred pistoles, poor Britannicus will pay for
			Andromache.</p>

			<p>&#8216;Gourrilu has probably given you the perfumes you ordered for your
			pretty cousin; Martial would not receive the money. He said that he
			was in your debt. Dubroussin sends his love. We had such a charming
			supper at his house! You were the only one wanting. I was
			obliged to bring Chapelle home in my carriage, dead drunk: to pay for
			it, I left him the next day under the table at <i>La Pomme de Pin</i>, where he
			has passed more than one night.</p>

			<p>&#8216;I shall try to get to the levÃ©e next Sunday. My uncle is doing his
			best to make me rejoin my regiment. If he should succeed, I shall see
			you on my way. I should much prefer to have the meeting take place
			here; but whatever happens, believe me, etc.,</p>

		<h2 class="title">ON RIVERS AND OTHER THINGS.</h2>

		<div class="epigram">
			<p class="centered_line"><span class="first_word">If</span> I were as tedious as a King, I could find in my heart to bestow it all on your worship.</p>
			<p class="sign"><span class="author">Shaks.</span></p>
		</div>
		<p><span class="first_word">It</span> is a comfort still remaining to me, to reflect, that after all the evil
		that the Tourists, the Reviewers and the Satirists of England together
		have said and done and imagined of America, they have never yet annihilated
		our Lakes; dispossessed us of our Rivers; disproved our Waterfalls;
		nor made bitter to us, our fountains and streams and brooks and
		water-courses. I thank <span class="special_name">God</span> with a full heart that from whatever cause
		these still abide unchanged among us; still flow, still control the ear
		with the majesty of sound, and make glad the solitary places of the
		heart.</p>

		<p>It is not often indeed that they admit the existence of these objects in
		set terms; nor introduce into their works a paragraph upon the subject:
		nor would any one who had never visited America be expressly informed
		perhaps by them, that our part of the world contained within its
		compass any thing at all comparable in the way of Rivers to the Thames
		or the Tweed; or to the ponds of Cumberland in the way of Lakes; or
		to the Pisse Vache in Switzerland in the way of a fall of water: but
		yet they have not deprived us of them; and, incidentally, when they
		sometimes mention their having been shockingly annoyed and incommoded
		by a scrub, who spat several times upon the floor of the steamer
		in their presence, during a trip of three hundred, five hundred or a thousand
		miles that they have had the mishap to make with him, (instead of
		using his stomach like a true born Englishman, or his parti-coloured
		flag of abomination like a continental personage,) they give the reader
		some idea of the scope of a River or of a Lake in America. Or, when
		they note down that a parcel of knaves, with sterling money of the
		realm of Great Britain, borrowed doubtless for the purpose and, as they
		verily believe, never repaid to this hour, bought a merchant ship; loaded
		her with every variety of live animals like an ark, and then cruelly
		and nefariously precipitated her over the Falls of Niagara, in order to
		gratify that national tendency for a great <span class="special_name">Splash</span>, which exists universally
		in every form throughout the whole of that wretched experiment at
		self-government called the United States&#8212;they then give the untravelled
		reader some conception of an American Fall of Water. One may
		therefore with confidence write down in a grave Essay like this, and
		expect it to be believed even by those who have not Morse&#8217;s Geography
		before their eyes, that there still is, and long has been, a fall of Water
		by common courtesy distinguished as The Cataract of Niagara; and a
		river in the State of Connecticut, called, without any of our &#8216;usual&#8217; cisatlantic
		inflation, Connecticut River.</p>

		<p>I pass over all further preliminary matter, and proceed at once to
		state, that the steamer which leaves New-York in the course of the afternoon,
		enters, during the night, the long and tranquil expanse of water
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page350" name="page350"></a>350</span>known by the name of the Connecticut; and that when the passengers,
		after a quiet night&#8217;s rest, assemble upon decks that are moist with dew
		in the bright, still, cheery morning of the early summer, they are gliding
		onward far up that river, cutting its glassy bosom in the direction
		of the rays of the rising Sun; the overpowering lustre of which is
		diminished by a soft and precious Claude-like haze that hangs like a
		gauze of gossamer on the borders of their way, a bridal veil just being
		lifted by the Sun; tempering while it enriches the gilding of the
		shores, the waters, the far-off spire, the contented farmer&#8217;s house and
		barns, the unfrequent trees, the cattle gazing at the approaching object,
		the sail you are overtaking or meeting, and often, the fisherman, seen in
		the distance, standing in his boat on the margin of the river, in his white
		shirt-sleeves, waiting the passage of the steamer.</p>

		<p>For these shores very rarely form themselves into any picturesque acclivity.
		Hardly is there on the whole course of the river one bold bluff
		or headland to obstruct the sight; and the scenery might even be
		thought tame and uninteresting, but for a home-born feeling that comes
		over the kind heart as it approaches so close to the mowers on the meadow-field
		as to scent the fragrance of the hay; to hear the song of the
		Boblink, or the rhythmic whetting of the scythe; or passes the ends of
		those primitive, those pilgrim-fences of post and rail, that enter the brink
		of the river to mark the boundaries of the small, paternal, and though
		frequently sterile, the much loved fields into which this home of industry
		is divided.</p>

		<p>The moment you have passed the fisherman, and the noise and movement
		of the steamer have frightened the fish toward the shore, he darts
		out in his boat with one end of a net of many roods in extent, takes a
		semi-circular sweep and frequently draws in again with very little delay
		fraught with a school of most luxurious Shad. It is of this fish that
		Basil Hall I think says it is worth crossing the Atlantic to taste them;
		and although I fear I may shock the prejudices of some of my friends
		who highly favour those of the Delaware when caught above Bordentown,
		I cannot but opine that the shad of the Connecticut is the best shad in
		the Union.</p>

		<p>The opinion if incorrect may have arisen from the freshness with
		which I have beheld them taken and have partaken of them from these
		nets, brought without the least bruise or violence on board the steamer
		which lies &#8216;blowing off&#8217; for a moment or two while it receives on the
		forward deck a rich supply for breakfast of these broad thick-backed
		fellows, all wet and spangling from the River, as stout at the dorsal fin
		as at the shoulder, leaping hither and thither astonished at the suddenness
		of the change, pausing at each instant to expand the deep pomegranate-coloured
		gills that decorate their small and beautiful heads, and
		puffing on the deck as if the air they inhaled could be nothing else but
		water; or else imagining and planning an escape into their proper element;
		and at each exhalation after a desperate leap, vying almost with
		the dolphin in the richness of the hues of purple green and gold upon
		the laughing scales!</p>

		<p>Now, one fine fish lies extended at its length, wondering and appalled
		and tremulous with fear, as the cook&#8217;s assistant, for the first time that
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page351" name="page351"></a>351</span>any human being has touched it, lays his hand upon the fullness of that
		line of beauty, the curved and satisfying swell that extends from the
		head to the graceful little swallow tail that flutters and pleads so eloquently
		for its wonted employment. &#8216;Heavens! is it possible,&#8217; it says
		to itself&#8212;I mean that beautiful female shad on which the hand is just
		laid&#8212;&#8216;can it be that this warm hand is that of man; that the tradition
		of our forefathers is indeed true; and that this fish-devouring monster
		is going to destroy me after a mystick fashion of his own, so different
		from that of the porpoise and the sturgeon, whom I have escaped so well!
		Is it for a fate like this, that, avoiding the Delaware river and the profound
		Hudson, I have returned to these scenes of my nativity and earliest
		youth! Is it for an end so cruel as this, that I have taken such
		care of myself upon the southern shores of this unworthy continent,
		feeding with a tasteful choice and epicurean delicacy amid the marine
		vegetation that adorns its milder latitudes, and plumping and beautifying
		myself into this admired shape, and all to gratify at last the cormorant
		appetite of this unfishlike animal, and decorate, with my remains
		and memory, a mere steam-boat breakfast! O Dickens! <em>the</em> Dickens!
		sworn enemy of the enemies of my race! thou Hannibal of my expiring
		hopes&#8212;&#8217; Alas! her apostrophe is cut short at the moment by the ruthless
		knife that strips her of her coat of many colours, and in one fell
		stroke prepares her delicious belle-ship for the broil!</p>

		<p>It forms no part within the scope of our intention in the present Essay,
		to dwell upon the various modes of cookery of this annual and precious
		accession to the riches of our waters; but it is not to be supposed that
		the arrival of the <span class="special_name">Shad</span> in this beautiful river of Connecticut can be a
		slight advent to the inhabitants upon its borders, particularly in villages
		and towns too densely populated to admit the idea, that their occupants
		derive a livelihood, either from agriculture, fishing, or the commerce
		that can be maintained by the yearly launch of a square-rigged vessel
		or two, depending mainly on the profits of a freighting voyage: now
		that the trade with the West-Indies, (formerly a rich source of the
		wealth of this state,) has dwindled into insignificance and loss. On the
		contrary, the first appearance of the shad imparts an hilarious sensation
		of abundance all along the shores. The retired sea-captain, the small
		annuitant, the broken-down family, and the capitalist, are all alike interested
		in the welcome. The price falls immediately within the compass
		of the very poorest inhabitant, while the luxury of the regale it furnishes
		is one that the richest epicure might covet. The green lanes
		that lead toward the shore, and that at other seasons are hardly visited
		except by lovers on a moonlit evening, now grow lively with the morning
		movement of the householder and his flock of little ones.</p>

		<p>The poor man&#8217;s cow now no longer browses there in a neglected and
		undisturbed possession; now no longer does the stiff and shackled
		plough-horse graze leisurely along the path, but is startled by some
		youthful shout into an attempt at what was once a leap; now half-ripe
		berries are furtively gathered in spite of all advice as to unwholesomeness;
		dogs move round as if upon a hunt and on the scent for game;
		the yoked goose, after more than one expression of its sense of dignity,
		retires a little out of the way; and now the ground sparrow, deeming
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page352" name="page352"></a>352</span>his thistle or over-hanging Barberry-bush insecure against the incursions
		of all these comers and goers, regrets at a short and watchful distance,
		and with all the anxiety of a politician, that he had not built more
		wisely under covert of <em>the other side of the hedge</em>.</p>

		<p>Boys and girls, young men and maidens, old men and widows, meet
		each other on the path of the green lane, like angels on the steps of
		Jacob&#8217;s Ladder in a Flemish picture that I have, where the ladder is represented
		by a broad stone stair-case; except that blessings are here all
		brought <em>up</em> instead of <em>down</em>, for a brace of Shad is in the hand of every
		family-man returning from the shore.</p>

		<p>Cordial greetings are every where interchanged, and every where the
		question rises or is answered that determines the market value of the
		morning; that makes known the signal success of the great haul of
		Enoch Smith; the further fall of prices in the perspective; and the general
		promise of the season in the way of shad; and all agree that however
		large or small may be the supply, never, since the memory of man,
		have the shad been quite so good as they are this season; and that Connecticut
		River Shad are decidedly the best imaginable of all possible
		shad.</p>

		<p>Having in my purse the ring of Gyges, which is too ponderous for
		ordinary wear, I placed it on my finger and accompanied home unseen
		a hale bandy-legged old gentleman with a florid complexion, a benevolent
		wart upon his nose, an alert step, drab-breeches with thin worsted
		stockings of pepper and salt, plated buckles worn to the brass in his shoes,
		and silver ones at the knees, and the heaviest pair of shad that had appeared
		in the lane during the morning. I saw him deposit the Fish
		safely in his kitchen which he entered through a side gate, giving some
		strict injunctions to the cook with the air of a person who had certainly
		made a good bargain and was speaking to one who best knew how to
		appreciate it.</p>

		<p>We then wended our way together to a neighboring house where we
		were immediately admitted. A person older than the visitor, quite
		deaf, pale and suffering but without complaint, lay extended upon a
		couch in a soft chintz dressing-gown, afflicted with that sort of Will-o&#8217;-the-wisp
		gout, that takes the toe, the heel, the knee, the hip, the heart,
		the neck, the head, and hands, in turn: not in any graceful rotation, not
		in any quiet or systematic order; but that gratifies itself by darting with
		the quickness of the electrick fire to which it is allied, to the part least
		expecting or prepared to sustain the pang. Not an honest gentlemanly
		gout that will exhibit itself and meet one fairly toe to toe with the inflammation
		of undisguised passion; but an adder, a viper of the nerves that
		stings and flies; and darts and disappears before the flesh has even time
		to blush for its existence; so subtle yet so tormenting, so deep yet so
		evanescent, that the patient in his agony half wonders whether it be a
		malady of the body or of the soul; and only knows that it is a pain, aye
		marry &#8216;past all surgery!&#8217;</p>

		<p>Our invalid was now enjoying a momentary interval of ease, and
		welcomed his guest very cheerfully, although without attempting to do
		more than extend his hand to him and beg him to sit near. Notwithstanding
		all deafness the compliments of the morning, the enquiries
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page353" name="page353"></a>353</span>after different members of each other&#8217;s family, and the comments on the
		weather, were made and understood and interchanged with great facility,
		and the visit went off swimmingly; until the stout gentleman, probably
		actuated by his desire to speak of his successful purchase of the morning,
		ventured, at the first pause, to ask his acquaintance if he were
		fond of fish?</p>

		<p>&#8216;I thank you,&#8217; said the latter, &#8216;the mare is decidedly better; that
		bleeding in the hoof did her business completely, and I don&#8217;t doubt that
		by autumn she will be as well as ever.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;I asked you,&#8217; said the visitor, in a determined tone, and like a person
		who has something to say, &#8216;I asked you, whether you were fond of
		Fish?&#8217;&#8212;Alas! my masters! how many unnecessary, how many futile,
		how many absurd questions, among the idle words that are dignified
		with the title of conversation, are daily propounded in this grave world
		of ours! <em>Fond</em> of fish! Fond of <em>Fish</em>! and that fish, a Shad! and that
		shad, a Connecticut River Shad! and that Connecticut River Shad, a
		prime brace of shad! in the highest season, and the highest order, and
		the finest brace of shad in the entire haul of Enoch Smith, now yet
		quivering, without the loss of one radiant scale, upon the snow-white
		dresser of this man&#8217;s imagination! Ought I to call it, an imagination?
		Ought I to go on with the story, or abandon it as an impracticable thing?
		Fond of fish!</p>

		<p>Oh commend me to a life of leisure in a small town upon the right
		bank of the River Connecticut, and let my lease begin at the beginning
		of the shad season! Give me Enoch Smith to draw the seine, a green
		lane to conduct me to the river shore, and a Claude Lorraine morning
		for my day of purchase! Fond of Fish! Why what an idea, to be conveyed
		upon the subject of this brace of shad, from one Christian Being
		to another Christian Being, who had both&#8212;as it is to be supposed&#8212;read
		and studied the lives of the apostles! Fond of Fish!!!</p>

		<p>But the stout man, finding that he was not apprehended, reiterated
		the remarkable question; and in a still louder tone, exclaimed:
		I&#8212;asked&#8212;you&#8212;whether&#8212;you&#8212;are&#8212;fond&#8212;of&#8212;Fish?&#8217; making a
		pause between each of these peculiar words, and shooting the last word
		of the singular interrogatory out of his mouth, by means of his fore-teeth
		and a most emphatic under-lip, as a boy does a marble with the
		bent fore-finger and thumb of the right hand.</p>

		<p>&#8216;I perceive,&#8217; said the quiet person upon the couch, &#8216;that you are
		asking me a question; but really the <i>rhumatis</i>, (this is the way in which
		the quiet person upon the couch thought proper to pronounce it,) has, I
		think, quite got the better of my right ear. Would you do me the
		favour,&#8217; continued he, turning the left side of his head toward his interlocutor
		with the suavity of a person already obliged, &#8216;would you do me
		the great favour to repeat your enquiry?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;I asked you,&#8217; said the other, growing scarlet in the gills like the shad of
		his imagination, &#8216;I&#8212;merely&#8212;asked&#8212;you,&#8217;&#8212;for he began (I thought
		at the time) to grow vexed with the absurdity of his position in having
		given utterance to a conception at once so feeble and yet so eccentrick;
		and being a coarse man, could only get out by passionately going
		through what he had to say; &#8216;if&#8212;you&#8212;were&#8212;fond&#8212;of&#8212;Fish?&#8217;
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page354" name="page354"></a>354</span>And on this occasion each word seemed to me to have the force of a
		pistol-shot, and the last word that of a cannon ball; and he rose as he
		spoke like a man of might and purpose as he was, and clenched his
		hand, and quivered upon the stout bow legs that sustained him as he
		stood: &#8216;<em>Fish</em>,&#8217; roared he! &#8216;<span class="special_name">Fish</span>,&#8217; shouted he! &#8216;I asked you if you were
		fond of FISH,&#8217; thundered he!</p>

		<p>&#8216;I quite regret being so very deaf to-day, and yet I should be sorry,&#8217;
		replied his imperturbable friend, fumbling in his pockets and looking
		about the couch, &#8216;to lose any observation of yours, and particularly
		one in which you seem so earnest; here is a piece of paper, and here
		is a pencil; be kind enough to write it down while I get on my glasses.&#8217;
		By the time his eyes were reinforced the paper was ready, and glancing
		it over he answered at once, raising himself suddenly upward, as he
		exclaimed at the utmost reach of his voice and with deep and increasing
		energy, &#8216;Oh, Very!&#8217; &#8216;<em>Very!</em>&#8217; &#8216;<span class="special_emphasis">Very!</span>&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Good morning, Mr. Johnson,&#8217; said his now blown and indignant visitor.
		&#8216;Are you off? Well, good morning, captain!&#8217; replied the other; and
		as soon as the door was closed, &#8216;My neighbor Captain Tompkins, I am
		sorry to perceive, has grown quite as deaf as myself,&#8217; said he in a
		musing manner. &#8216;If I had his legs&#8212;&#8217;tis there he has the advantage of
		me&#8212;if I had his legs, I could have collected all the news of the parish
		in the time that he has been prosing here about my mare! And I wanted
		too to know something this morning about shad. Here, Sally! tell Bob
		to run down the lane and find out whether Enoch Smith is going to draw
		soon; and if Bob meet any persons on the way with shad let him ask
		the price of the day before he says a word to Smith.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Away flew the little flaxen-haired fairy with her eyes of sapphire,
		leaving her grandfather to relapse upon his couch in the posture in
		which we first saw him, and to moralize on the impatience with which
		his neighbour Captain Tompkins seemed to bear the approaching infirmities
		of age. And now, Dear Reader, do thou emulate the patience of
		the old Valetudinarian, while I relieve thee of my further presence; or,
		if thou wilt permit the thought to enter the charities of thine heart, vanish
		from thee like the blue-eyed girl.</p>

		<h2 class="title">REMINISCENCES OF A DARTMOOR PRISONER.</h2>

		<h3 class="subtitle">NUMBER TWO.</h3>


		<p><span class="first_word">It</span> was my intention in closing my last number to have opened the
		next in the prison, and then to proceed with the narrative; but upon
		reflection, I thought it might be more acceptable to the reader if I were
		to relate all that took place; giving as it were a moving panorama of
		the events as they occurred: but if he should be in greater haste to get
		to the prison than I was, he has only to skip a few lines, to arrive there.
		But to proceed. Our vessel, with several others, anchored at Gravesend,
		where the crews received their pay. The amount coming to me,
		although small, was very acceptable. I now received from the captain
		what he ought to have given me on my joining his ship. I had stipulated
		with him, on signing his papers, that he should give me a written
		pledge, exonerating me from fighting against my country, should we fall
		in with any of our vessels. This he withheld until the end of the voyage;
		and then, when it could be of no possible use, he most magnanimously
		gave it to me. What the result would have been had we fallen
		in with any of our cruisers, is beyond conjecture.</p>

		<p>All was now bustle and confusion on board. The ship was like a
		floating Babel. The decks were crowded with hucksters, boatmen,
		landlords, and women of <em>undoubted</em> character; all upon one errand,
		and actuated by one motive; united in purpose though divided by interest,
		they were bent upon fleecing poor Jack of his hard-earned money.
		No doubt they succeeded, for Jack is at best but a poor financier.</p>

		<p>Amid the confusion, I managed to slip unobserved on board a Gravesend
		boat which was crowded with passengers, and in a few minutes
		was flying before a smart breeze, on my way to London. It was past
		sun-down, and the shades of evening were fast veiling surrounding objects
		as we approached this vast and mighty city, the heart&#8217;s-core as it were
		of the world. I cannot express my feelings, nor convey by words the
		ideas that swelled my mind until the sensation became intensely exciting,
		as the dusky spires of the Tower, St. Paul&#8217;s, etc., peered above
		the smoky atmosphere. All that I had read from early childhood of
		London, its bridges, towers and domes, came rushing and crowding upon
		my memory. It was lamp-light when we landed at Wapping, (gas was
		then unknown,) and I felt the full force of my lonely condition. Young
		and inexperienced; surrounded by vast multitudes, yet known to none;
		I was completely bewildered.</p>

		<p>I was aroused from my reverie by a person touching my elbow, and
		inquiring if I wanted lodgings. He was a keeper of a boarding-house;
		and thinking I might as well be imposed upon by him as by any other of
		the fraternity, I accepted his offer to show me to his house. I went home
		with him, and agreed to pay him a guinea per week for such board and
		accommodations as might be had for half that price by any one but a
		stranger. I ate more fresh salmon during the short time I tarried with
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page357" name="page357"></a>357</span>him, than I ever did before or since. I infer from this that it must have
		been very cheap, as his object was more to make money than to accommodate.
		I was in London about three weeks, and during that time
		made the best use of my poor means to learn all I could of a place I
		had longed but never hoped to see. As I traversed Tower Hill, my
		mind wandered back for centuries, and dwelt upon the strange events in
		history which had been enacted there; of the soil where I stood, that
		had been moistened by the blood of monarchs, soldiers and statesmen.
		As I gazed upon the massive gray walls of the Tower, the magic scenes
		of Shakspeare arose, and passed in review before me. I thought of
		Gloucester, Clarence, Hastings, Henry VI., his two murdered nephews:
		then came forth the unhappy Jane Shore, pale, exhausted, and starving;
		no one daring to offer a mouthful of food to save the poor wretch from
		death. But the scene changes. It is night; and I see Falstaff and his
		companions at the rising of the moon, &#8216;by whose light they steal.&#8217; They
		go forth and are lost sight of in the misty shadows of those dark, time-worn
		buildings; and anon we hear him waging battle with the &#8216;ten men
		in buckram suits.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Bartholomew Fair came on while I was in London. This I was desirous
		of witnessing; to see how far it would accord with the descriptions
		by &#8216;rare Ben Jonson,&#8217; some centuries before. The weather proved
		remarkably fine, and I set out with my curiosity on tip-toe to see the
		sport. I had some distance to go; and as I turned up one street and
		down another, the throng of people increased, until my arrival at Smithfield,
		where the fair was held, and where the crowd became so dense as
		to be hardly passable. The spectators consisted of both sexes, of all
		ages and degrees. But how shall I describe the scene that presented
		itself? A large field of several acres was filled with tents, stages and
		booths, with Punch and Judys, quack doctors, mountebanks and monkeys,
		and cages containing wild animals of various kinds. The shouting
		of people, the cry of beasts, the beating of drums, the discord of
		the abortive attempts at music, producing such a triumph of discord as
		beggars description. &#8216;Verily,&#8217; thought I, &#8216;time cannot have diminished
		the glories of Bartholomew Fair.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Years have rolled on and passed by like the waves of the ocean, since
		I traversed the streets of London, but many a laugh have I had to myself
		as memory recalled a whimsical mistake which I stumbled upon in
		my peregrinations. In passing the streets I frequently saw fine portly-looking
		men dressed in blue coats, faced and trimmed with a profusion
		of broad gold lace; breeches and white stockings, and shoes with large
		buckles, and on their heads cocked hats or chapeaux, as large as coach-wheels.
		&#8216;Thinks I to myself,&#8217; the continental wars are over, England
		has recalled her fleets, and the streets of London are swarming with
		admirals of the white and blue, off duty. What a blunder! They
		were a pack of fat, lazy footmen! My respect for what I supposed
		were the heroes of &#8216;England&#8217;s wooden walls&#8217; was turned into contempt
		for men who could debase themselves by strutting about in the livery of
		those whom God created of the same materials as themselves. I sometimes
		(but very rarely) see such things in my own country; but when
		I do, my face burns with indignation at both master and man, to think
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page358" name="page358"></a>358</span>that the one should require, and that the other should submit to such
		degradation.</p>

		<p>I spent two or three weeks, as above stated, endeavoring in the mean
		time to get away as a hand on board some vessel bound to any port out
		of the jurisdiction of the British government. This I found more difficult
		than I had supposed; for London was at this time literally crowded
		with seamen dismissed from the China, Bengal and West-India fleets.
		I began to be anxious, as my money was getting rather low; and
		although I felt comparatively safe from being discovered among so great
		a multitude, still I thought it much the safest plan to get off if I could.
		It would have been well for me if I could have accomplished it, for notwithstanding
		my supposed security, I was suspected and watched. One
		day as I was seeking to obtain a situation on board a vessel bound to
		Marseilles, I was accosted by a suspicious individual. I was soon made
		acquainted with his business, and in a few hours I was on my way to
		prison. I did not much regret it. My money was all gone; and as
		the date of my first imprisonment was from an early period, I was in
		hopes of being among the first sent home, should a cartel be despatched
		with any of the prisoners. I was in a sad mistake, as it was only
		United States&#8217; seamen and soldiers who were exchanged. Had I imagined
		half of the trouble and sorrow that awaited me, I should have
		acted with more caution; but it was too late, and I had to abide my fate.</p>

		<p>It was a beautiful morning in autumn, and our journey was through
		a delightful country. The fields were enclosed in hedges instead of
		fences, which had a novel and pleasing effect, especially to me, as I was
		not accustomed to seeing the like; and I should have enjoyed it very
		much had I been on any other errand than going to prison. It was near
		sunset when we arrived at a bend in the river Medway, where lay
		moored several huge dark hulls, that were once the bulwark of the fast-anchored
		isle, but now used as receptacles for those who had the misfortune
		to become prisoners of war. We were soon swept alongside
		by one of the watermen in attendance, and in a few moments more were
		on board the &#8216;Irresistible.&#8217; I was conducted below and introduced to my
		future associates.</p>

		<p>It was several minutes before I could discern the objects around me.
		It was like going into a cellar. The only air and light were admitted
		through port-holes, few and far between, which were left open for the
		purpose, and secured by strong iron gratings to prevent escape. As
		soon as I regained the use of my sight, I began to look around me
		to &#8216;define my position;&#8217; and I believe it would have puzzled the ingenuity
		of the most acute politician to know where he stood, had he been
		placed in the same &#8216;fix&#8217; as myself. Casting a glance around, I found
		myself amidst a squalid, cadaverous throng of about six hundred, ranging
		from about fourteen to sixty years of age; and I never beheld a
		set of more wretched human beings. They were nearly starved and
		almost naked, and wholly unable to take exercise, from their crowded
		condition. It was too dark to read, and they yielded their minds up to
		corroding despondency, and became sullen and morose. Their features
		became rigid; and to see a smile upon a face was like a sunbeam illumining
		a thunder-cloud.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page359" name="page359"></a>359</span>I must here record an unparalleled instance of self-denial, love and
		devotion in the female character, seldom to be met with. One of the
		prisoners in making frequent voyages to the English ports, (I believe
		Liverpool,) had become acquainted with and married a young English
		woman early in the war. He was taken and sent on board one of these
		ships. No sooner was this made known to his young and affectionate
		wife, than she resolved to partake of all the hardships, privations, and
		imprisonment with him; and never ceased her exertions until she had
		accomplished her purpose. In admiration and respect for her heroic
		virtues, and kind feelings toward her husband, the prisoners screened
		off a small space for them with old canvass, etc., although much to their
		inconvenience, owing to the crowded condition of the ship. It was
		amid these trials and privations that she became a mother, and was
		covered by the American flag. They are now living in Newark, New-Jersey,
		enjoying each other&#8217;s society in the down-hill of life, and surrounded
		by a numerous family.</p>

		<p>The prisoners were divided into companies or messes of six each; the
		provisions, which were very coarse and scanty, were prepared in a
		cook-house erected on the forward part of the upper-deck, and when
		ready, passed to the prisoners down below. Hammocks were provided
		for them to sleep in, which were slung side by side, so close as hardly
		to admit a passage between them. They were three tiers deep, bringing
		the lower ones within three feet of the floor. No light was allowed, and
		of course all was in utter darkness. And it was quite a perilous undertaking
		to go on a necessary excursion across the deck at night. Many
		was the one who became so bewildered in his journey that he could not
		find his lodgings, and had to sit down and quietly wait until morning;
		at which time all hands must turn out, lash up the hammocks and
		pass them upon the upper deck to be stowed away until night came
		round again, in order to make more room below. Several guards with
		loaded muskets and fixed bayonets constantly paced the upper deck;
		and aft, on the quarter-deck, were two carronades loaded to the muzzle
		and pointed forward. Two or three of the prisoners were permitted to
		come on deck at a time; but at night none were allowed on deck for
		any purpose whatever; the entrance being secured by strong gratings,
		and sentries stationed by them continually.</p>

		<p>Time passed wearily on. Days seemed months and months appeared
		to be lengthened into years; and even existence itself had become as it
		were paralyzed by the monotonous life we led. It was an interposition
		of Divine Providence, that in our destitute and helpless condition we
		were not afflicted with any pestilential disease; as in the crowded state
		we were in, it must have made rapid and fearful havoc in our midst.
		At length it was rumored that the prisoners were to be removed; but
		where to, none of them knew. Several weeks passed on, and they were
		relapsing into their ordinary indifference to the state of things around
		them, when one morning word was passed among us that a draft of one
		hundred was to be sent to Dartmoor prison, and those who thought proper
		might volunteer; but that <em>that</em> number must go at any rate. So seeing
		it was &#8216;Grumble you may, but go you must,&#8217; was the order of the day,
		the number required soon availed themselves of the <em>privilege</em>, and were
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page360" name="page360"></a>360</span>sent in barges on board the vessel which was to convey them to their
		future abode. Other drafts were sent from time to time, until the whole
		were removed. For myself, I remained until the last: I felt a reluctance
		to leave what I knew to be bad, for what I feared might be worse.
		It was to a &#8216;bourne whence no traveller returned&#8217; to disclose the secrets
		of the prison-house.</p>

		<p>At last the time had arrived when the remnant were to leave. We
		were all mustered upon deck, numbering about one hundred and fifty.
		Our baggage, poor and scant as it was, we had need to take the utmost
		care of, as winter was advancing, and we knew of no means of procuring
		more. We were then conveyed in barges and put on board the
		&#8216;Leyden,&#8217; an old sixty-four gun ship, taken from the Dutch in by-gone
		days, and now used for a transport for troops, prisoners, etc. In due
		course of time we were landed in Plymouth. It was early on a bleak,
		cloudy morning, late in the autumn, that we disembarked, and were
		placed in immediate line of march, under a guard of a sufficient
		number of soldiers with loaded muskets, who had orders to shoot down
		the first who evinced a disposition to leave the line. The whole was
		under the command of a captain, lieutenant, etc., who were on horseback.
		We had been on the road scarcely an hour, when the rain,
		which had been threatening all the morning, now came down with
		sweeping fury; and although not sufficiently cold to freeze, yet it possessed
		a keenness that appeared to penetrate the skin. The roads being
		of a clayey soil soon became of the consistency of mortar by the tramping
		of so many feet, and our march might have been traced for several
		miles by the old boots, shoes, and stockings, which were left sticking in
		the mud in the hurry of the march. I have no doubt that we made a very
		grotesque appearance, and raised many a smile from some of the passers-by.
		Our march continued throughout the day without interruption,
		save occasional short halts to bring up those who lagged behind; for
		many began to be exhausted from cold, fatigue and hunger. We had
		not tasted a morsel of food since the day before.</p>

		<p>As we advanced, the scene became more gloomy. Habitations
		became fewer, and the hedged and cultivated fields gave place to moors
		and &#8216;blasted heaths;&#8217; and the sombre hue of the sky imparted the same
		tone to our feelings. Night had now overtaken us, and the rain was
		still pouring down in torrents. Way-worn and hungry, we hailed our
		gloomy prison, which now presented itself, and we looked upon it almost
		with joy. From the darkness of the night we could scarcely discern
		the dim outline of its lofty walls and ponderous gates, as they swung
		open, grating upon their hinges, to engulf a fresh supply of misery
		within that sepulchre of the living. We were now thrust into a building,
		reeking wet and benumbed with cold. All was in total darkness, and
		we were in dread of breaking some of our limbs, should we undertake
		to explore the limits or condition of our prison. As it was, we were fain
		to lie down upon the stone pavement which formed the floor of our abode.
		In this state we passed a long and weary night, without bedding or covering
		of any kind, as our baggage had not yet arrived. A description
		of the prison of Dartmoor, and of the scenes and occurrences which took
		place within its walls, I shall defer to a subsequent number, as it would
		occupy too much space to be embodied in this.</p>

		<p><span class="first_word">How</span> thoughtful in you, my kind <span class="first_word">Editor</span>, to have inquired of me

		and doors were all open, and as I glanced here and there, with what

		and with what a feeling of delirium did I launch into the warm air

		just now returned, freighted with pleasant thoughts, to my closed windows,
		coal-fires, and other northerly necessities. But for this, Sir, I
		thought to have done with these &#8216;Sketches,&#8217; as I like not that ambitious
		heading. &#8216;Gossip&#8217; would have been better, Sir, and more appropriate;
		and under that modest title you would not have used the unintelligible
		stars that blaze to so little purpose in my last paper. Ah!
		Sir, you should have considered how difficult it is to gape&#8212;shocking
		word!&#8212;to gape gracefully!</p>

		<p>And now to your queries: &#8216;Is the alligator fond of his grandmother?
		Does he devour his children? Does he hanker after little niggers? Is
		he wholly depraved and given up to the sins of the flesh, or hath he some
		social and playful qualities? And, lastly, what are his habits of life?&#8217;
		You have given me quite too long a text, Sir: the more especially as I
		think, that upon most of these points the animal is decidedly non-committal;
		but not to hesitate for a single moment in answering your implied
		slanders, I declare, in short, that if the alligator affect his grandmother,
		it is not made public; and if he grieveth after little niggers,
		there are no leavings of evidence; as I take it, he hath no partialities,
		no mincing of morsels, no preference of parts.</p>

		<p>I wish you to observe, Sir, at the start, that I have no resentments to
		gratify, no vengeance to wreak, no sins to compare, allegatorically.
		I am not rejoiced at being able to say, after some miserable deed, &#8216;So
		does the alligator.&#8217; Nor do I think it necessary to impute evil from the
		difficulty of proving it. Such, to be sure, is the way of the world. The
		loftier, the more unimpeachable the character, the greater is the probability
		that it contain some hidden vice, some reach of horror quite worthy
		of concealment; and so it is, that after much sinning ourselves, (not before,)
		we attain to the relish of gossip, the deliciousness of scandal. A
		scandal proved, the excitement is over; but to imagine, to wonder, to embellish,
		to hover with a sneer, or a tear, as the humor happens, over a
		probable enormity, is the devil&#8217;s own pleasure, and to a taste properly
		matured, said to be very delectable. It is in this manner that unthinking
		fathers have amused themselves and their children with stories of an
		animal which on <em>close</em> acquaintance they would treat with far more
		respect.</p>

		<p>Pardon my gossipry, ah! kindest of Editors! while I ask if you believe
		in the lastingness of primary impressions? And furthermore, is
		a countenance pleasant or otherwise from the humor with which you regard
		it? Is a place forever associated with the rain or sun that falls
		upon it at your first acquaintance? In running over the brightest of
		my pleasant days at St. Augustine, and there are few links wanting in
		that brilliant chain, I am just now reminded of lounging one morning
		at the market, with mind and waistcoat thrown open to all sunny impressions,
		when I observed afar off a small colored gentleman, who was
		coming toward me with a directness of motion quite unusual to people
		of his class.</p>

		<p>As the morning was a little breezy and he had but one simple garment,
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page363" name="page363"></a>363</span>rudiment, so to speak, between him and the outer world, I attributed
		his precision and firmness of step to a sense of delicacy as commendable
		as it is rare in those parts, and immediately resolved that I would
		look with a kind regard upon that individual: I would parley with him,
		detain him with some idle thought, while, all unknown to him, I could
		seize that moment to pry into his dark and mysterious nature, and if he
		proved modest and upright, as no doubt he would, how would I astound
		him with a gratuitous half-bit! Or if he resented that, (it might be,) I
		would have him at nine-pins; I would send him of errands; make up
		objectless and <em>boot</em>-less employment, if necessary, and so contrive to
		benefit him unawares; to cherish and sustain his high moral tone, and
		at some future day, (it was not impossible,) raise him to the dignity of
		trowsers! I would do this without casting a single shadow upon his
		unsophisticated nature; I would not deepen his complexion with a single
		blush!</p>

		<p>On coming nearer, I discovered that he was carrying suspended in
		one hand what appeared to be specimens of some rare and curious vegetable;
		strange roots, medicinal perhaps; bulbous, yet elongated, and
		beet-like at the lower extremity, but dark and rough like an artichoke;
		which, on close examination, proved to be young alligators. The little
		nigger had them by the tail, and they were moaning like kittens in the
		blindness of their first days. I afterward discovered that they were not
		in good voice, from the circumstance of being carried so long in that
		unnatural manner. But what was my surprise, my delight, that an
		animal so Egyptian in association, so hieroglyphical, so suggestive of
		dragons and monsters, could be so delicately small, so infantile, so perfectly
		harmless! There were three of them, each about six inches long,
		counting the tail; but how long they had been that long, or whether
		they had ever been shorter, it was impossible to say. One could not
		but ask, were they weaned, or were they just &#8216;out?&#8217; but no one could
		divine. We may be tolerably certain, however, that their mother was
		not aware they were out, otherwise small Bob would doubtless have had
		no farther rolling of marbles in those parts; no riding of my little gray
		all over town &#8216;just to air him&#8217; as he said; no running for Massalini, the
		triangle and the tambourine, for our evening dances. They were not
		very lively, being, as I have stated, almost gone with grief or pain, one
		could hardly tell which, not being acquainted with their manner of expression.
		Placed upon the ground, they were quite still and speechless;
		no throbbings of fright; no extraordinary circulation, as far as I could
		discover. It was at this time, however, that on looking closer, I observed
		a strange expression of countenance; a wild look in the eye; a kind
		of mute horror there expressed; wondering at which, the popular belief
		flashed upon me at once, and I gave small Bob a look which puzzled
		him exceedingly. &#8216;Can it be then,&#8217; said I, chasing this thought
		about in a distracted manner, &#8216;can it be possible that their mother would
		not have defended them from small Bob?&#8212;but that, on the contrary, (it
		is a horrible thought,) she would&#8212;would have anticipated that nigger?
		Were they born with an instinctive dread of that mother? Did
		they look shudderingly from some pin-hole in their shells before venturing
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page364" name="page364"></a>364</span>into a wet and miserable world, where their first and last thought
		must forever be to avoid, as death and destruction, those who should
		have brought them their first morsels; who should have warned them of
		the rattlesnake; who should have preserved them from the cat-fish?
		Alas! here was the bitterness of that knowledge of evil at the first
		breath of life!</p>

		<p>But waiving all this: how readily you will anticipate, Mr. <span class="first_word">Editor</span>,
		that I at once said to myself, I would possess those alligators. I did.
		They were put up at auction, and the whole lot came down to me at
		half-a-bit each, the smallest coin of the country, but a fortune to small
		Bob. Bob and I went home with a new sensation! Apples and marbles
		to Bob; to me, something to study, to fuss over, to care for. How
		refreshing, after the excitement of balls and late suppers, to retire, and
		still better to rise, upon alligators! How primitive, how scriptural,
		how pyramidal in suggestion! A large tub with sufficient water to
		cover them well, was placed in the yard, and tilted a little, so that they
		could crawl out into the sun; a choice of vegetables and meats thrown
		in for supper; and the whole family of blacks, by virtue of half-bits,
		were put in special charge of the contents. As additional security, the
		old dog was shown, and disliked them; cats were banished; the bear&#8217;s
		chain made stronger; and, not unimportant, my room looked out upon
		the tub. The next morning they were inspected and found to be a
		trifle better in condition; but I was mortified more than I care to express,
		that they had wholly refused the dainties we had given them. And
		this they continued to do, so that for more than a week thereafter, no
		one had seen them eating. If they had manifested any dislike to any
		thing we offered, it would have been something to build, to speculate
		upon; and with my after experience, I should have had my suspicions;
		but all our relishes, and different solutions, salt water and fresh, and
		half-and-half, were received with the same indifference. Notwithstanding
		this, they grew livelier every day, and as I thought, in better
		spirits. Held up by the tail, they would bark something like a puppy
		when he first begins to think himself a dog; a quick bark, with a brusque
		abruptness, and wondering intonation, as though equally surprised and
		delighted at being able to speak so well. From this circumstance,
		<span class="keep_together">Mrs. &#8212;&#8212;,</span> who roomed next door, and had a great variety of lizards, as
		pets, very early exhibited a decided repugnance to mine, which I found
		it impossible to remove. She thought they were vicious. I maintained
		the contrary; insisted that they were a species of enlarged lizard;
		and that to take any thing by the tail was always a severe trial of temper.
		&#8216;Not to inquire,&#8217; said I, &#8216;as to the affinity in the words <i>cauda</i>
		and <i>chordis</i>, (the heart and tail of all things,) I beg to remind you, Madam,
		how irresistible is the wag of the dog&#8217;s tail when he is pleased;
		how graceful the curl of the cat&#8217;s; and how earnestly the calf, that model
		of innocence, laboreth to raise <em>his</em> what little he can; and as to being
		held by the tail, what are the facts? The dog is indignant, the cat
		is furious; in short, all animals resent it as an impertinence; and I
		submit, could an alligator do less?&#8217; But <span class="keep_together">Mrs. &#8212;&#8212;</span> <em>refused</em> to like them.
		I was one day taking my half dozen puffs at a cigar, (quite enough in
		that climate if you would avoid the siesta,) looking down from the balcony
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page365" name="page365"></a>365</span>with an air of abstraction upon that tub, and puzzling myself as to
		what could be the particular whim, the acceptable morsel to the palate,
		of a young alligator, when the thought of fiddlers, the frisking, tempting
		inimitable fiddlers, came to my mind so easily, that I was vexed so evident
		a thing could have been overlooked. At that moment Bob was
		stirring up the bear with a long pole. &#8216;Bob,&#8217; said I, shouting across
		the yard, &#8216;Bob! fiddlers!&#8217; &#8216;Eh?&#8217; said Bob. &#8216;Fiddlers, Sir, fiddlers,
		you rogue; run and get a bucket, a whole bucket full.&#8217; The fiddlers
		were soon brought, and a handful of them thrown into the tub, when to
		my utter astonishment the alligators sidled off to high-water mark, and
		wholly declined their acquaintance. But here was an excitement at
		all events. They were not indifferent. And now, were they disgusted,
		or did they affect that? It was difficult to say; but the next morning
		the fiddlers <em>had disappeared</em>! If fiddlers had not been abundant in that
		country they would now have been at a premium, for they continued to
		disappear as often as they were furnished; and as evidence that they
		did not escape from the tub, the &#8216;pets&#8217; now grew sensibly, barked
		louder and with more firmness, and were in some degree playful. I do
		not mean that they had any of that silly affectation which we see in most
		young animals; such as the kittenish grasping at imaginary mice, or
		the dog&#8217;s shaking of a stick, with the idea that it is something very
		vicious; fallacies all, which seriously considered are so pitiable and
		lamentable; I could detect nothing of that credulous nature; but sometimes,
		on coming suddenly upon them, I would find them lying side by
		side, their fore-feet put forward, and their three noses laid together on
		the sunny side of the tub, with an air of confidence and trust that was
		very interesting to witness. Indeed, there was something kindlier in
		it than you would think of an alligator.</p>

		<p>As to my object in keeping them, there were various rumors afloat
		about town, in the utterance of which, libellous as some of them were,
		<span class="keep_together">Mrs. &#8212;&#8212;</span> was perhaps the loudest and most malicious; she having
		hinted, among other scandalous conjectures, that the soup from alligator-tail
		being very palatable and delicate, a speculation was afoot contemplating
		the supply of the northern market with that article. About
		this time, also, some of her lizards were missing, and thought to have
		found their way to the tub; but all surmises were soon cut short by the
		first cold night of that winter, (one of them in February,) which chilled
		the water so that the &#8216;pets&#8217; next morning were quite stiff, and apparently
		dead. By careful nursing, however, two of them were thoroughly
		revived, and made to articulate distinctly; but having no thought of a
		second cold night in the same winter, the waters closed over them again,
		a thin ice shut out the air, (they had not presence of mind, I suspect,
		to come to the surface,) and on the morning of the second day they were
		quite gone. And now, in closing this history, I do not want to be uncharitable,
		but I suspect <span class="keep_together">Mrs. &#8212;&#8212;</span> was privately rejoiced at their
		death; indeed, the whole community, otherwise very sensible and not
		devoid of sentiment, seemed to regret the circumstance much less than
		would have been expected.</p>

		<p>It will be seen, Mr. <span class="first_word">Editor</span>, from this account of the alligator, that
		I can say nothing as to what habits he may form in after-life; what
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page366" name="page366"></a>366</span>evil he may learn, what original sins he may develope and mature;
		what temptations his power and bloody instincts may present to him;
		what evil resorts he may be driven to, in an ungrateful world, when he
		has become case-hardened and impenetrable to outward impressions;
		or, in short, what contempt he may acquire for the fiddlers and cabbage-leaves
		of his early days. And what he may do in those vast lagoons
		where he is undoubtedly master, or in the black depths of the St. Johns,
		where the water hides the blood he may shed, and the long moss screens
		him from the tiger; what orgies he may celebrate, what abominations
		he may practice, when there is none to call him to account; all this I
		can only conjecture; but I conjecture on the charitable side. In the
		upper waters of the St. Johns I have seen them in their death-throes;
		huge animals, at least fifteen feet long; seen them in scores at a time,
		some swimming about, some tumbling in clumsily, some sprawled on
		shore, apparently asleep, and some raising their black claws as if to
		call down vengeance upon us, gnashing their teeth, and lashing the
		water in their death-agony; but the howlings and smothered thunder
		that others tell of, came not to my ears; and the exhibition, so furious to
		others, was to me only the involuntary muscular action of pain and
		dissolution. Extravagant stories are told of their great strength and
		tenacity of life, and wonderful exploits are recounted by the great mass
		who have lived since Agamemnon. While staying over night, not in
		Egypt, but at the plantation of Doctor <span class="keep_together">W&#8212;&#8212;,</span> a short time before his
		place was despoiled by the Indians, he related an encounter, which
		though not so remarkable, is undoubtedly true to the letter.</p>

		<p>The doctor in his earlier days had been in some sharp battles against
		Napoleon, having been a staff-officer to one of the smaller kings of Europe;
		and although an exceedingly kind and benevolent man, his skirmishing
		faculties were still lively and unimpaired. In this fight, which
		came off at Indian River, he of course commanded the engagement,
		but as it proved, not with his usual success. The alligator, one of
		enormous size, was so far from the river when discovered, that the
		doctor had time to call in his gang of men, and make a general attack.
		Seizing an axe in one hand, and shouting &#8216;Charge!&#8217; to his men, all
		who could get a footing mounted the back of the animal, with a
		view to stay proceedings till the doctor could despatch him; but to their
		surprise, the old fellow walked off with his burden with apparent ease.
		The doctor then waived off his men, and mounting himself, drove the
		bit of the axe through his hide, probably at the fore-shoulder; but from
		wrenching, or some other cause, it was found impossible to remove it.
		The doctor hinted that the heart clasped the bit by strong muscular exertion,
		with a view to his own private use; but this being speculative
		merely, I only mention the fact. As he was now nearing the water
		rapidly, a rope was slipped round the butt of the helm, a quick turn
		made around a stiff sapling on the bank of the river, and all hands made
		fast to the rope. At this moment, just as they were all braced, the alligator
		made his plunge into the water, and the sapling, I don&#8217;t remember
		how large, very large however, came up by the roots, and they all went
		to the bottom together! Some of the negroes, however, came back.</p>

		<p>Another Doctor <span class="keep_together">W&#8212;&#8212;,</span> who, unlike his venerated namesake, still
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page367" name="page367"></a>367</span>lives to relate the marvels of a life unusually varied, has a remarkable
		store of incidents, encounters, and other matters, quite alligatorical.
		The doctor will forgive me, if I mistake, but I think he told me that the
		monsters in the neighborhood of his plantation had in several instances
		stolen his butcher-knives and chopping instruments; a fact which he
		made quite certain, by seeing them use the knives in a family way on
		the other side of the lagoon; and that on one occasion, he was quite
		astounded at seeing a large alligator making tracks for the water on
		three legs, with a pitch-fork and crow-bar in his jaws, and a hand-saw
		erect and glittering from his right arm! Upon these last, however, I
		do not pronounce.</p>

		<p>And now to sum up <em>my</em> opinion of the animal. I believe that notwithstanding
		these astounding tales, he is rather peaceful and well-disposed,
		when properly trained, but hath very strangely fixed upon
		him an idea, not entirely original with him, that the world owes him a
		living; that he makes drafts that way to an advanced age; that he is
		non-committal, except upon such matters as he can commit to his private
		keeping; that his stomach in that respect has great capacity; that
		he is not over-nice in his diet; is plain and unassuming; is not puffed
		up, seeing that his hide will not much admit of it; and if he resemble
		himself to a log adrift, he considereth not what foolish creatures may
		alight upon his back, or swim within his jaws; he barks no invitation,
		nor does he flourish with his tail to excite their curiosity; and if they
		happen in his way when he has done yawning, it is <em>their</em> business, not
		his.</p>

		<p>Lastly, what do I say to the prevalent notion that the waters of the
		St. Johns, which resemble brandy and water, half-and-half, are colored
		by the blood of his victims? Answer&#8212;<em>it is not so</em>. I have drank of
		those waters for weeks together (stopping occasionally) and even deepened
		the color, in a manner peculiar to those who travel in those parts,
		without feeling half as sanguinary as I do at this moment, from the
		bare thought of that foul and malicious slander.</p>

		<p>These are the matters of faith; the facts, I give you are but two,
		and perhaps only true of his younger days; that he eateth fiddlers in
		secret, and dies in a temperature of twenty-six Fahrenheit.</p>

		<h2 class="title">THE QUOD CORRESPONDENCE.</h2>

		<h3 class="subtitle fancy">Harry Harson.</h3>

		<h4 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER XXIV.</h4>


		<p><span class="first_word">Harry Harson</span> strode into his own house, with his jolly face brimful
		of cheerfulness. It shone out of his eyes; out of the corners of his
		half-closed mouth; and even out of his full, round double chin. Every
		part of him seemed glowing with it; and no sooner had he got in his
		parlor, than he flung his hat on the table; snapped his fingers over his
		head in perfect ecstacy; made the hazardous experiment of a slow
		pirouette around the table, and concluded his performances by making
		two or three passes with his cane at the nose of Spite, who had been
		watching his conduct with an air of extreme surprise, not unmingled
		with disapprobation. The attack upon himself was carrying the joke
		too far; and after several ineffectual attempts to avoid the point of the
		cane, with a discontented grumble, between a whine and a growl, he
		retreated under an old side-board, sadly troubled with misgivings as to
		the state of his master&#8217;s intellect.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Ha, ha! old pup! you don&#8217;t understand the science of fence; but
		don&#8217;t take it hard. I&#8217;ve got a drop of comfort in store for you; for
		we&#8217;re to have a blow-out, Spite&#8212;a real, regular, out-and-out blow-out&#8212;ha!
		ha! And you shall be under the table during the whole of
		it,&#8217; exclaimed Harson, rubbing his hands together, and chuckling with
		indescribable glee. &#8216;I&#8217;ll speak about it at once.&#8217; He opened the door
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page369" name="page369"></a>369</span>and bawled out, in a voice that made the old house shake: &#8216;Hallo!
		there, Martha, Martha, come here, quick!&#8217;</p>

		<p>A frantic rush across the kitchen was heard, succeeded by a violent
		clatter of slip-shod shoes through the entry; for Martha, since the late
		burglary, being haunted in idea by shabby looking gentlemen with
		pistols in their pockets, and dark lanterns under their arms, even in
		broad daylight, was on the look-out for emergencies, and had every
		thing ready for speedy egress to the street, either through the front door
		or the cellar window; and the tone of Harson&#8217;s voice being that of a
		man in extremity, had such an effect upon her, that when she reached
		the door, she could only gasp out:</p>

		<p>&#8216;Lor&#8217; me! is they here ag&#8217;in?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Who?&#8217; demanded Harson, not a little surprised at the pale face of
		his housekeeper.</p>

		<p>&#8216;The robbers.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Poh, poh, nonsense!&#8217; replied he, perhaps not a little annoyed by the
		reflection that his own manner had contributed to her mistake. &#8216;There
		are no greater thieves here than our two selves. Perhaps I <em>did</em> speak
		rather loud; but I was not thinking of what I was about. I shall have
		some friends to dine with me to-morrow, and you must get things ready
		for them. There may be six, or eight, or a dozen; damme! I don&#8217;t
		know how many; but have enough for twenty; d&#8217;ye hear?&#8217;</p>

		<p>Martha curtseyed, at the same time intimating in a faint tone, that
		she <em>did</em> hear; for she had not entirely recovered from the embarrassment
		attendant on the precipitancy of her advent into his presence.</p>

		<p>&#8216;And hark ye!&#8217; continued Harson, warming as he went on; &#8216;Frank&#8217;s
		the very devil and all; we&#8217;ll tap the cask in the corner of the cellar.
		It&#8217;s prime stuff, which I&#8217;ve kept for some great occasion; and this is
		a glorious one. And there&#8217;s the fat saddle of mutton, hanging in the
		store room: we&#8217;ll have that. It&#8217;ll be the very thing for the half-starved
		boy we&#8217;ve found; and bring down a bottle or two of the red-seal wine;
		that of 1812. It&#8217;ll wake up old Dick Holmes, and make him ten years
		younger. There&#8217;s no fear of giving <em>him</em> the gout. Ha, ha! Dick
		Holmes with the gout! I&#8217;d like to see that!&#8217; exclaimed he, bursting
		out into a broad laugh at the bare idea of such a catastrophe. &#8216;Well,
		well,&#8217; added he, after a minute&#8217;s consideration, &#8216;you may go, Martha.
		Upon the whole, I think I&#8217;ll get the things myself, and go to market too.
		There, that&#8217;s all.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Harson&#8217;s spirits however were too exuberant to permit him to remain
		quiet; for after he had returned to the room, drawn a chair to the fire,
		thrown on a few sticks of wood, seated himself with a foot on each
		andiron, folded his hands complacently over his abdomen, and fixed his
		eyes upon the clock, as if it were a settled thing that he was to retain
		this attitude for at least an hour, or perhaps a year, he suddenly started
		up, thrust his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets, and walked up and down
		the room, whistling with all his might; but even by whistling, he was
		unable to work off his surplus of buoyancy. It was evidently gaining
		ground upon him, do what he would. He had reached his present state
		by rapid stages. From a feeling of complacency he had passed to one
		of high satisfaction; from that to one of mirthfulness; thence he advanced
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page370" name="page370"></a>370</span>rapidly to one of joviality; and he was now fast verging upon
		one of uproariousness. Something must be done! Excessive steam
		bursts a boiler; why should not a similar surplus of delight burst a
		man? He wouldn&#8217;t risk it! He must find some vent for it. Ha! ha!
		It just occurred to him that the widow hadn&#8217;t heard the news. He
		clapped on his hat, seized his cane, and sallied out into the street, in his
		haste shutting in Spite, who had started to follow him, and who yelped
		mournfully for an hour afterward, to the great edification of a thin
		maiden lady, who resided next door, and was indulging herself with a
		nervous head-ache.</p>

		<p>There must have been something in the expression of Harson&#8217;s face
		which bore the stamp of his feelings; for as he trudged along, with a
		free independent air, striding as lustily as if only twenty instead of sixty
		years had passed over his head, and as if every sinew were as well
		strung, and every muscle as firm as ever; not a few turned to take a
		second look at his hearty, honest face; for such an one was not often
		met with; and as they did so, observed: &#8216;There goes a jolly old cock.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Rap! rap! rap! went the head of his cane against the door of
		Mrs. Chowles&#8217;s blinking old house; but he was too much at home to
		think of waiting for a reply, and had gone through the ceremony only
		for the purpose of removing from his entrance all appearance of being
		underhanded or surreptitious; for no sooner had he knocked with one
		hand, than with the other he raised the latch and walked without hesitation
		toward the widow&#8217;s little parlor.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Ah, ha! my visit will be a surprise to her!&#8217; thought he, as he took
		the knob of the door in his hand. He was a true prophet. A faint
		scream escaped the lady, for she was opening the door to come out
		at the very moment he was doing the same to enter; and as the
		movements of both were rapid, the lady precipitated herself into his
		arms, which in a most unexpected manner closed about her, while three
		hearty smacks were deposited on her forehead before she well knew
		where she was.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Mr. Harson!&#8217; exclaimed she, extricating herself, though without
		any appearance of anger; &#8216;is it you?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;By Jove, I believe it is!&#8217; replied Harson. &#8216;If it isn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s some gay
		fellow of twenty or thereabout, for I haven&#8217;t been so young for thirty
		years as I am to-day.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Mrs. Chowles saw from his manner, and knew from the unusual hour
		of his visit, that there was something on his mind which he had come
		to communicate; and as she was not of that class who take pleasure in
		keeping others in suspense, especially when she was liable to be a
		fellow-sufferer, she drew an easy chair to the fire, and taking a seat
		in another, said: &#8216;Sit down, Harry. Now, what is it? what ails you?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;What ails me?&#8217; exclaimed her visitor, turning his round joyous
		countenance to her; &#8216;look at me. Don&#8217;t you see what a boy I&#8217;ve
		grown; how the wrinkles have gone from my cheeks, and how clear
		and bright my eye is! Look at me, from top to toe. See how jolly I
		am, and hear how loud and lusty my laugh is: Ha! ha! ha!&#8217;</p>

		<p>The lady <em>did</em> look at him; and <em>did</em> observe all the peculiarities to
		which he called her attention; and <em>did</em> listen to his loud ringing laugh;
		and then, not knowing what to make of him, drew away.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page371" name="page371"></a>371</span>&#8216;Aha! widow, you&#8217;re frightened at finding yourself alone with such
		a gay fellow!&#8217; said he, laughing still more merrily. &#8216;Well, well, don&#8217;t
		be alarmed, for I&#8217;m not in the least dangerous; and to tell the truth, I
		am so overjoyed to-day that I may be indulged in a little foolery. But
		I&#8217;ll keep you no longer in suspense. You recollect little Annie, the
		little child who fled to my house for protection?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Yes; well?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;And you remember too, how often I told you that that poor starved,
		cast-off little thing looked to me like one born for a better destiny, and
		like one who had seen brighter times; and how often you ridiculed me,
		when I spoke of the faint recollections which still flitted through her
		mind of sunnier hours; and how you said that they were merely dreams,
		and that I was almost as great a child as she was, to attach any weight
		to them; though you admitted&#8212;I&#8217;ll give you credit for that&#8212;you <em>did</em>
		admit that she was a beautiful, good little thing, and worthy to belong
		to the best in the land. And when I said that Providence never would
		have sent such a frail being as that into the world as a beggar&#8217;s brat,
		you told me, on the contrary, that <span class="special_name">He</span> <em>might</em> have cast the lot of that
		child, frail, feeble, sickly as she was, amid the very outcasts of the
		earth for wise purposes, which we never could fathom; and that I had
		no right to reason in that way on the subject, or to comment on <span class="special_name">His</span>
		doings. And there, widow,&#8217; added he solemnly, &#8216;you were right, and I
		was very wrong. But I was correct in my surmises as to the child.
		She <em>was</em> born for a brighter destiny, even than my humble roof; although,&#8217;
		added he, his voice somewhat choked, &#8216;she&#8217;ll never be where
		they&#8217;ll love her more. But it&#8217;s all right, and she must go; for her
		parents are discovered. They <em>are</em> of the best in the land; she is <em>not</em>
		a beggar&#8217;s brat. Her brother too, is found; a miserably, thin hollow-eyed
		fellow; but we&#8217;ll put flesh on him. This is not all,&#8217; added he,
		&#8216;every body seems in luck to-day. Old Jacob Rhoneland has escaped
		scathless out of Rust&#8217;s clutches. Rust himself is on his way to the
		devil post-haste, and there is nothing left to be done but to heal the
		breach between Jacob and Ned. This matter settled, I hope to see
		Kate&#8217;s cheeks once more plump and round and rosy. I hope not only
		to <em>see</em> them, but to <em>kiss</em> them too. I&#8217;m not too old to fancy such things,
		I can tell you; and now, widow, hadn&#8217;t I a right to be a little boisterous?
		Ah! I see that you think me excusable; but bring me a pipe, and I&#8217;ll
		give you all the particulars over that. I&#8217;m a little thirsty, too; for
		I&#8217;ve already told a long story, and have yet a longer one to tell.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The pipe was produced; the small three-legged table was placed at
		his side, to support his elbow; and Harson, having carefully lighted
		his pipe, suffered the smoke to eddy about his nose, while he arranged
		his ideas, and cleared his throat; and then he entered into a full and
		faithful detail of the proceedings which had been taken to unmask the
		villany of Rust; and the various steps and precautions which had
		finally led to success.</p>

		<p>It was a pleasant sight to see two such persons as Harson and his
		crony, both in the autumn of life, but with the charities of the heart yet
		green and unwithered, talking and gossipping together, with eyes bright
		and beaming with mutual admiration; each fully aware of the foibles
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page372" name="page372"></a>372</span>of the other, but carefully indulgent to them; for each knew that the
		heart of the other was an odd casket, encasing a gem of the noblest
		kind, from which radiated love, charity, and benevolence to man. Oh!
		Harry, Harry! how joyously and yet mildly you looked into that widow&#8217;s
		dark liquid eyes; and how gently and confidingly she returned that
		look! What a risk you both ran! Had you and she been but a few
		years younger, had either of you cherished a whit less tenderly the
		memory of those who had once been all in all to you, and whose forms
		were slumbering under the green sod, that widow might have been a
		wife, and Harry Harson no longer a stout, sturdy old bachelor; for it
		cannot be denied, that he <em>did</em> become a little animated as he proceeded;
		and that he <em>did</em> take the widow&#8217;s hand in his, and did squeeze it, perhaps
		with a little too much freedom, and did look into her eyes, as if he
		loved her with his whole soul and body into the bargain; nor can it be
		denied that she was pleased with these tokens of esteem, or love, or
		friendship, or whatever else she might have thought them; for she did
		not withdraw her hand, and <em>she</em> smiled when <em>he</em> smiled; and there certainly
		was a strong sympathy apparent in their looks; and even when
		in the fervor of his feelings he held his pipe between his teeth to free
		the hand which held it, and deliberately squeezed <em>both</em> of her hands in
		his, still she did not appear embarrassed, nor vexed; and when he had
		released it, quietly went on with her sewing, as composedly as if what
		he had just done was quite usual, and a matter of course.</p>

		<p>&#8216;And now, Mrs. Chowles,&#8217; said Harson, as he concluded his narrative;
		&#8216;upon the strength of our success we are to have a jollification to-morrow
		at my house; and we&#8217;ll have Dick Holmes there, and Kate, and
		Ned Somers, and Kate&#8217;s father. He must make up with Ned then, if
		not before. He knows he was wrong, and he must give up.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;But will he?&#8217; inquired the widow, anxiously. &#8216;You know Jacob&#8217;s
		a wrong-headed old man, in some things. Will he?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Wont he?&#8217; ejaculated Harson, with a peculiar wink and nod of
		satisfaction, as if he and himself were on excellent terms, and understood
		what they were about perfectly well. &#8216;I tell you what it is,&#8217; added
		he, in a more grave tone; &#8216;Jacob has had his own way, or rather Michael
		Rust&#8217;s way, in this matter, too long. He shall have it no longer. He
		<em>shall</em> not break his child&#8217;s heart. I will not permit it.&#8217; He took his
		pipe from his mouth, and slapped his knee emphatically. &#8216;Have you
		observed no change in the girl, since then? If <em>you</em> have not, <em>I</em> have.
		She is still the same devoted, affectionate child to that warped old man
		that she always was; but look at her face and form, and listen to her
		voice. She was once the gayest, merriest little creature that ever lived.
		It threw sunshine into one&#8217;s heart only to look at her; and when she
		spoke, did you ever hear a bird whose voice was half so joyous? Poor
		thing! when she laughs now, it makes my heart ache. It&#8217;s like the
		smile of one dying, when he is trying to whisper hope to those who are
		weeping over his death-bed. God bless her! and how should it be
		otherwise? But no matter; the worst is past. And now,&#8217; said he, &#8216;I
		must be gone. I came here to tell you the story, and to ask you to dine
		with us; and between you and me, perhaps you had better come early
		in the day, and keep an eye over Martha; for the idea of a dinner
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page373" name="page373"></a>373</span>party has quite frightened her; and there are so many little things to
		be done, which I know nothing about, and which you understand, and
		without which we should have every thing helter-skelter, that you must
		come, or I&#8217;ll never forgive you.&#8217; Harry made this last menace with
		so fierce an air, and his mouth pursed up in so ferocious a manner,
		although his eyes were dancing with fun, that the lady consented at
		once.</p>

		<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s well for you that you did,&#8217; said Harson, rising and putting on
		his hat; &#8216;if you hadn&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t know what I should have done; but it
		would have been something dreadful. I&#8217;m a terrible fellow when fairly
		roused.&#8217; Then shaking the lady&#8217;s hand, as if he intended to dislocate
		her shoulders, he put his cane under his arm and went out.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Ha! ha! old Jacob! you and I must have a tussle. Ha! ha!&#8217; exclaimed
		he, still carrying his cane under his arm, and his hands under
		his coat tails, &#8216;you must hear a little of what I think. A few words of
		wholesome advice will do you no harm, and will rub off the rust that
		old age has fastened upon you.&#8217;</p>

		<p>With this hostile resolution upon his tongue, the old man made the
		best of his way to Rhoneland&#8217;s house. Jacob was there, dozing in his
		chair, with his white locks hanging loosely over his shoulders; and
		Kate was sitting at his side engaged in sewing. She was paler than
		usual; and there was a nervous restlessness in her manner, which did
		not escape the quick glance of Harson. He thought too that she seemed
		somewhat thinner than she was wont to be. It might be mere suspicion,
		but still he thought so.</p>

		<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s too bad,&#8217; muttered he; &#8216;but I&#8217;ll set matters right, or my name&#8217;s
		not Harry Harson.&#8217;</p>

		<p>There was something in the hearty greeting of the old fellow, as he took
		her hands in his and called her his bright-eyed girl, so full of happiness that
		it was impossible not to catch the same feeling as he spoke; and even
		Jacob, as he felt the cordial grasp of his hand, assured himself, and assumed
		something like a cheerful smile.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Well, Kate,&#8217; said Harson, drawing a chair between her and her
		father; &#8216;I&#8217;ve news for <em>you</em>; and for <em>you</em> too, my old fellow,&#8217; said he,
		turning to Rhoneland; &#8216;we&#8217;ve used Rust up.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Jacob stared at him, smiled faintly and half doubtfully, and then sank
		back in his chair without speaking.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Do you hear me?&#8217; exclaimed Harson, seizing him by the collar and
		shaking him; &#8216;do you hear me? Why don&#8217;t you jump up and hurrah
		at the downfall of such a scoundrel? Ha! ha! We&#8217;ve been on his
		track for months; but we&#8217;ve run him down at last; and then he made
		a virtue of necessity, and told all&#8212;all about the children, and about
		you, and about Ned; all lies, all lies&#8212;every word of them: Ned he
		swore was as honest a fellow as ever lived, or something to that effect.
		<em>You</em>, he admitted, had committed no forgery; not a word of truth in it;
		but all invented, to force you to consent to his marriage with my own
		little sweet-heart, Kate. God bless me! how near I was to losing her!
		Perhaps you don&#8217;t know that I intend marrying her myself? Why
		don&#8217;t you get up now, and hurrah? Confound it, I never saw such
		people in all my life. Halloh! by Jove! Kate, quick! some water!
		I swear, the old fellow has fainted!&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page374" name="page374"></a>374</span>As he spoke, Rhoneland&#8217;s head fell back, and the color forsook his
		cheeks. Harson caught him, while Kate ran for water and brandy, a
		small quantity of which being poured into his mouth, soon brought him
		to himself. Having waited until he was sufficiently composed to listen,
		Harson commenced from the beginning of his story, and detailed to both
		of his listeners much that they already knew, and not a little which
		they had never dreamed of; the causes which had first led to the enmity
		between Grosket and Rust, and then, step by step, what they had
		done to detect and bring to light his villany. &#8216;Rust manÅuvred well
		and skilfully,&#8217; said he, &#8216;for he was a bold, reckless man, who stuck at
		nothing, and fought to the last. It is doubtful whether he would not
		have got the better of us in the end, had not a sudden misfortune fallen
		upon him, which prostrated his energies and broke his hard heart. After
		that, he was no longer the same man; but confessed every thing, and
		among other things, that it had been his intention to become the husband
		of Kate, and finding that you were opposed to it, he tried the effect
		of a display of wealth upon you. This failed. Then he resolved to see
		what fear could do; and threatened to have you indicted for forgery;
		and admitting that you were innocent, he yet showed so clearly how he
		could support his charge, and succeed in blasting your character, that
		you shrunk from collision with him: still you would not consent to sacrifice
		your child, although you dared not give him such an answer as
		would shut out all hope. There was another obstacle in his way.
		This was a certain young fellow, who as well as Rust, had an eye on
		Kate, and whom perhaps Kate did not think the worst man in the
		world. Rust determined to be rid of him; so he basely slandered him
		to you; and you, not suspecting Rust&#8217;s veracity, as the knowledge which
		you already had of his character should have induced you to do, rashly
		forbade his rival the house; and I am sorry to say, added harsh words to
		the wrong which you were already committing. I need not tell you
		who that young man was. He came to me shortly afterward and told
		me what had occurred. He&#8217;s a noble fellow, for not one hard word or
		epithet did he breathe against you. He said he was aware that for a
		long time back some person had been endeavoring to poison your mind
		against him. He had observed it in the gradual change of your manner,
		and in your avoiding his society. He had hoped, he said, that in
		time, when you found out that his character was fair and irreproachable,
		that these hard feelings would wear off, and you could again meet
		as heretofore. But this was not to be. Instead of diminishing, your
		hostility to him increased, until one day when he was in your own house,
		you used language to him which left him no alternative but to quit it
		forever. The charges which you made against him were very grave,
		Jacob, and very vile; and when you made them you had no right to
		withhold the name of the person on whose authority you accused him;
		but you did; and although Ned might and did suspect one person,
		Michael Rust, to be the kind friend to whom he owed your ill will, yet he
		had no proof of it that would justify him in calling him to account.
		Ned had a hard task before him; for the charge you made against him
		was that of harboring evil thoughts and of cherishing unfair designs
		against your child. It was a serious charge, and one that he could not
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page375" name="page375"></a>375</span>refute; for a man&#8217;s thoughts are not susceptible of proof; all that he
		can do in justification, is to point to his past life and say: &#8216;Judge by
		that;&#8217; and unless Ned could impeach the character of his traducer, of
		whom he was then ignorant, but who now stands revealed in the person
		of Michael Rust, as great a scoundrel as ever lived, he had no alternative
		but to submit, and to hope that time would exculpate him. Now
		Jacob, even supposing Rust had not confessed that the tales which he
		had told you respecting Ned were calumnies, is there any thing in Ned&#8217;s
		past life to justify the suspicion you have cherished against him? Answer
		candidly, and you will answer &#8216;No.&#8217; Rust&#8217;s motive was clear enough;
		he feared Somers, and wished to drive from you one who might be a
		friend in time of need, and who might one day stand as a shield between
		you and his dark purposes. Come, Jacob, Rust has confessed
		all; what he did, what his motives were; and now, tell me, whether you
		cannot say, from the bottom of your heart, &#8216;Ned Somers, I have wronged
		you?&#8217;&#8217;</p>

		<p>He paused, and looked earnestly at Rhoneland, while every feature
		glowed with the fervor of his feelings. &#8216;Come, Jacob, what do you
		say?&#8217;</p>

		<p>There was one other person too who leaned forward to catch the reply;
		but Rhoneland answered:</p>

		<p>&#8216;She&#8217;s my only child, and she&#8217;s very dear to me. It was a cruel
		suspicion, and perhaps I <em>did</em> act hastily. I will not say that I <em>did not</em>,
		for I was greatly excited, and said many things that I have since forgotten.
		But it was better that he should go. Wasn&#8217;t it, Kate?&#8217;</p>

		<p>He turned to his daughter, took her hand, and repeated his question.
		&#8216;Wasn&#8217;t it better that he should keep away Kate?&#8217;</p>

		<p>Kate&#8217;s voice trembled as she asked: &#8216;What harm did he do, father, in
		coming here? If his character is fair, why should he not come?&#8217;</p>

		<p>Her father eyed her with an uneasy look. In truth, he feared Ned&#8217;s
		presence; for he knew that he loved Kate, and that she reciprocated
		the feeling; and with the selfishness which old age sometimes brings
		with it, he was unwilling that she should care for another than himself,
		or that another should have a claim upon her. At last, he replied
		rather sharply: &#8216;The reason why he should not come, is because I don&#8217;t
		want him.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Kate drew back, and said not another word; but Harson saw from
		her compressed lip that the reply had cut deeply; and catching her
		eye, he made a sign to her to leave them. Kate took the hint, and went
		out; and Harson, after looking Rhoneland steadily in the face for some
		time, said, &#8216;Jacob, you have given <em>your</em> reason why Ned Somers should
		not come here. It&#8217;s a very poor one, and not such as I expected. Now
		I&#8217;ll give you <em>mine</em> why he <em>should</em>: Kate loves him, and he loves her.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Jacob knit his brows, but made no reply.</p>

		<p>&#8216;And let me tell you, too, that unless you <em>do</em> consent, your child will
		die. I&#8217;m in earnest. There are some who fall in love, as they call it,
		a hundred times; bestowing their affections, such as they are, sometimes
		on one, sometimes on another; until at last perhaps the owner of
		a handsome face offers his hand and gets in return the tattered thing
		they call their heart. God help me! this is called <em>love</em>. But thank
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page376" name="page376"></a>376</span>God, for the credit of human nature, there are others who love as they
		should&#8212;purely, nobly, with their whole soul. These love once, and
		only once; and wo to the man who unwisely, or for his own selfish
		ends, crosses them! The sin of a broken heart too often lies at his door.
		Jacob, you&#8217;re an old man; but you are not too old to have forgotten
		the wife who once was yours. You loved her well, my dear old fellow,
		I know it,&#8217; said he, taking his hand. &#8216;She deserved it too. Kate is
		very like her. What would have been your feelings had any one
		stepped in between you and her?&#8217;</p>

		<p>Rhoneland grew very pale, and the tears came in his eyes.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Come, come, Jacob, I&#8217;ll not press the matter now; but you must reflect
		on what I&#8217;ve said; and you must not forget how much Kate has at
		stake. Ned&#8217;s a glorious fellow, and will make your house very
		cheery.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Well, I&#8217;ll think of it,&#8217; replied Rhoneland, after a short pause.</p>

		<p>&#8216;<em>Do</em>; that&#8217;s a good fellow. I&#8217;ll consider it a personal favor; and I
		<em>do</em> think you owe me something for the pains I&#8217;ve taken in aiding to
		rid you of that rascal, Rust.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;I do indeed owe you much,&#8217; replied Rhoneland, earnestly, &#8216;and I am
		sincerely grateful.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Well, well, we wont speak of that; only reflect on what I have just
		said; and by the way,&#8217; added he, rising to go, &#8216;you must oblige me in
		another matter. Two or three friends are to dine with me to-morrow;
		you and Kate must be of the party.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;We will,&#8217; was the reply.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Good! Now go up stairs and comfort Kate.&#8217;</p>



		<h4 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE.</h4>


		<p><span class="first_word">A bright</span> glowing day was the following one, the day of the dinner
		party; and right gladly did the golden sun beam out from the deep
		fathomless sky, as if from his lofty look-out he were aware of what was
		going on in this world below, and rejoiced in the failure of the evil machinations
		which had been so long disturbing the tranquillity of the worthy
		individuals who have figured in this history. And fortunate it was
		that neither clouds nor rain obscured his face, for had the latter been
		added to the cares which the approaching dinner-party had already accumulated
		upon the culinary department of Harson&#8217;s household, the
		house-keeper in the tall cap with stiff ribbons would have gone stark-mad.
		Miserable woman! how she worked and fumed, and panted and
		tugged, and kneaded and rolled, and stuffed and seasoned, and skewered
		and basted, and beat, on that day! From soup to dessert and from
		dessert to soup, over and over again, she toiled; fish, flesh, fowl, vegetables,
		gravies, were all mingled in her head helter-skelter. She had
		dreamed of nothing else during the whole of the previous night, excepting
		a short interlude in the aforesaid dream, when she was night-mared
		by a fat pig, bestrode by a half-starved boy, who was all eyes. And
		now, as the day waned and the hour of the dinner approached, her ferment
		increased, until, to use a metaphor, she had worked herself up into
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page377" name="page377"></a>377</span>a mental lather. Her voice was in every quarter, and so was her
		quick, hurried step. She was in the entry, up stairs, in the pantry, in
		the kitchen and in the cellar; at the street-door giving orders to the grocer&#8217;s
		dirty boy to bring the cinnamon and allspice, and not to forget the
		sugar and butter, and to be sure to recollect the anchovies and pickles.
		The next moment she was scolding the butcher, because he had been
		late with the chops and cutlets; and every five minutes she thrust her
		head into the room to look at the clock, lest Time should steal a march
		upon her. Eleven, twelve, one, two o&#8217;clock. The tumult increased.
		Mrs. Chowles, punctual to her promise, made her appearance; forthwith
		dived into the kitchen, and did not emerge until dinner-time. The
		only person utterly unmoved was Harson, who had attended to his part
		of the business by looking after the wine, and who now sat with his feet
		to the fire, resolved to trouble his head about nothing, and apparently
		more asleep than awake. At times, however, he rose and went to one
		corner of the room, where a small boy who seemed to be worn down by
		suffering, lay coiled up and sound asleep on a chair-cushion. The old
		man bent over him, gently parted the hair from his forehead, and then
		rising up, somewhat red in the face from the exertion, rubbed his hands
		one over the other by way of indicating that all was as it should be;
		stole back to his seat on tiptoe, lest he should awaken him, and forthwith
		relapsed into his former state of dreamy abstraction. Nothing could
		arouse him; not even the house-keeper when she dashed into the room
		with a face at roasting heat, and demanded the key of the wine-cellar.
		It was handed to her mechanically, and mechanically pocketed when
		she brought it back.</p>

		<p>But the hour of dinner drew near; and a smell began to pervade the
		house which aroused Harson at last. He sat up in his chair and smacked
		his lips; and Spite, who for an undue curiosity as to the contents of
		a small pasty, exhibited early in the day, had been escorted into the
		room by the house-keeper aided by a broomstick, sat under the same
		chair licking his lips and slavering profusely.</p>

		<p>Again the red face of the house-keeper was projected in the room, and
		as instantly withdrawn. It wanted half an hour to the time. In and
		out again; it wanted twenty-five minutes. In and out again; twenty
		minutes. The matter was growing serious, and there was something
		frantic in her looks. But this time Harson caught her, and told her
		that it was time to put an end to that performance, as he expected his
		friends every minute; that she must guess as to the time; and that he
		would ring when she was to serve the dinner.</p>

		<p>A rap at the door! and before it could be answered, a heavy step
		crossed the ante-chamber.</p>

		<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s Frank,&#8217; said Harson, rising and facing the door; and in
		came the doctor. But he was not alone; for close behind him followed
		Ned Somers, dressed in his best. Harry shook hands with them; but
		before he had time to do more than that, Jacob Rhoneland entered with
		Kate on his arm, looking very rosy from her walk.</p>

		<p>What could it be that caused Ned&#8217;s heart to flounce and dance about
		as wildly as a caged bird; and his cheek to grow at first pale, and then
		burning hot; and his lips to quiver, and his voice to tremble so that he
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page378" name="page378"></a>378</span>could scarcely speak; and for a moment was unable even to tell Kate
		that he was glad to see her? Whatever the complaint was, it was infectious;
		for Kate&#8217;s heart certainly did beat very rapidly; and her
		color went and came, until it settled into a deep burning blush, as she
		turned and saw Ned there, looking at her as if he had eyes for nothing
		else.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Good morning Mr. Somers,&#8217; said she, at last, in a tone that was neither
		firm nor clear.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Call me Ned, Kate,&#8217; said he in a low voice; &#8216;don&#8217;t say <em>Mr.</em> Somers.
		Wont you shake hands with me? There can be no harm in that.&#8217;
		He extended his hand; she placed hers in it, and at the same time
		whispered in his ear, (for Harry, seeing that there was some by-play
		going on, kept Jacob busy,) &#8216;Speak to father as if nothing had happened.
		I think he&#8217;s inclined to make up. <em>Do</em>, Ned.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Turning from him, she commenced talking to the Doctor, while
		Somers, after a moment&#8217;s hesitation, went up to the old man and offered
		his hand.</p>

		<p>Rhoneland hesitated, for he experienced the reluctance which old age
		always evinces to succumb to those younger in years; and it was not
		very pleasant to admit that his conduct toward Ned had been wrong.
		But there was something in the expression of Ned&#8217;s face, and even in
		the way in which he offered his hand, which showed that the past was
		forgiven; and beside that, what had already happened could not be
		mended by holding out; so Jacob grasped his hand, and said frankly:</p>

		<p>&#8216;Ned, my young friend, I wronged thee sadly. I hope you will pardon
		it.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s right, Jacob! Spoken like a whole-hearted old fellow, as you
		are!&#8217; exclaimed Harson, patting him on the shoulder. &#8216;To be sure he
		will forgive you, and thank you for the chance. If he doesn&#8217;t he&#8217;s not
		what I take him to be. Don&#8217;t you pardon him?&#8217; demanded he, turning
		to Somers, and at the same time casting a quizzical look in the direction
		of Kate.</p>

		<p>Ned laughed; said something about pardon being unnecessary, where
		no offence had been taken; and then commenced talking about indifferent
		matters.</p>

		<p>Presently Holmes came in; and after him Grosket; and one or two
		cronies of Harson&#8217;s; and then the little girl; so that the room became
		quite full. The boy too, aroused by the noise of talking, awoke; stared
		wildly around him, and though a boy of genteel lineage, evinced a
		great distaste to mingling in society; and fought manfully to retain his
		position in the corner, when Harson attempted to lead him out. His sister
		endeavored, in an undertone, to impress upon him the propriety of
		adapting his manners to the change in his situation; but it must be confessed
		that her success was but indifferent; and it is a matter of some
		doubt whether he would ever have emerged, had not a tall, awkward
		boy, (a second cousin of the housekeeper, and apprenticed to a tailor,)
		who had been borrowed to officiate as waiter on this eventful occasion,
		thrust his head in the door and remarked, &#8216;Cousin Martha says you may
		come to dinner just as quick as you like,&#8217; and forthwith disappeared,
		slamming the door after him, and clattering across the entry as if shod
		with paving-stones.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page379" name="page379"></a>379</span>This aroused the company; and this too emboldened the small boy,
		who being restrained by his sister from rushing in the room before any
		one else, nevertheless crowded in, and secured a seat at the table, opposite
		the best dish.</p>

		<p>What a sight! A table loaded with fish and flesh and fowl; glittering
		and glowing with cleanliness; linen as white as snow, and plates
		and dishes that glistened and shone until you could see your face in
		them, while the steam alone, which arose from each of them, might
		have made a lean man fat; and then there were the decanters too, in
		which the ruby wine sparkled, until it made even Dick Holmes smack
		his lips.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Aha!&#8217; ejaculated one of the neighbors, a thin, hungry fellow,
		with large eyes; &#8216;aha!&#8217; And he snuffed up the dinner as if he intended
		to appropriate it all, and as if, mistaking the table and its contents
		for a snuff-box, he supposed his nose to be the only member
		destined to play a part there.</p>

		<p>Harry paused at the head of his table, and said a short grace; and
		then seizing a carving knife, he plunged it forthwith into the fat saddle:
		right merrily the red gravy spirted out; and as he drew the knife along
		the bone, and cut out the long strips, the steam and savor filling the
		room, it was to be feared that the thin neighbor would have gone beside
		himself, lest his pet piece should be given to some one else before his
		turn came. But such a dinner as graced that table is a thing to be
		eaten, not spoken of; and so thought the small boy, who notwithstanding
		his genteel extraction, brought with him the appetite which he had
		acquired by education. A dreadful havoc he made in that fat saddle!
		It was labor lost for his sister to kick and pinch him under the table, in
		hopes of checking his course. He kicked backed again, but could not
		pinch; his hands were too busy. What eyes he had for the meats and
		gravies! what a deaf ear he turned to all invitations to waste his energies
		on bread and vegetables, or trifles of that sort! His appetite, though
		belonging to a child, was full grown, and needed no assistance. All that
		he required was quantity&#8212;and he got it.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Help yourself, my son,&#8217; said Harson, actually growing hungry by
		seeing the child eat. &#8216;Don&#8217;t spare any thing.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The boy looked up at him, and said nothing. He was a fellow of
		few words, but of great action; and for one of six years of age, he
		was a phenomenon; and displayed a capacity which would have done
		credit to a man or a barrel.</p>

		<p>The first course went off, and so did a second and third. Martha
		had excelled herself; a cooking-stove was nothing to her. Everything
		was praised; and at every fresh eulogy, the tall boy was missing from
		his attendance on the table. He had darted to the kitchen, to communicate
		the intelligence to his aunt. How <em>he</em> enjoyed that party! how
		he skimmed his fingers round the plates, as he took them through the
		entry; sucking the ends of them so loudly, that his aunt thought that
		corks were flying out of the porter-bottles! He was perfectly happy.
		One thing alone puzzled him; that was the knotty question why people
		couldn&#8217;t eat every thing off the same plate.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page380" name="page380"></a>380</span>It was remarked, that when the dinner was over, some of the guests
		were uncommonly mellow; and it is credibly asserted, that Dick Holmes,
		who had spent his life among parchment and cobwebs, had during the
		meal buried his mouth in the bosom of his own waistcoat, and had there
		been heard confidentially singing to himself a short song of an Anacreontic
		character. But be that as it may, when he rose from the
		table, his eye certainly was a little lively, and his spirits were high.
		Nor was there any flagging among the rest; for whether the jests were
		good or bad, or the songs poor, or the conversation common-place, certain
		it is, that a more jovial set had never met. Every one seemed to
		have been placed beside the person who suited him; Harry sat with
		Jacob on one side of him, and the widow at the head of the table, with
		the Doctor at her right hand; and Dick Holmes and Grosket together;
		and Ned and Kate, so close that their elbows touched; and Annie beside
		her brother; and her brother, although somewhat incommoded by
		his sister, directly opposite the fattest part of the saddle of mutton!
		And then the one or two neighbors, who knew no one except each other,
		seated in a knot, contrived to grow moist and merry, because the others
		did, and laughed because Harry did. Choice spirits! who could split
		their very sides, without a joke to abet them in it; weren&#8217;t they the
		fellows to help out a dinner party?</p>

		<p>When they separated, it was late at night. The doctor gallantly
		volunteered to escort the widow to her abode, which offer was accepted
		without hesitation. Harry remarked that as it was a fine night, he
		thought he would walk too.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Come, Jacob, you and I will go together,&#8217; said he, taking the old
		man by the arm; &#8216;and Ned, you look after Kate. No grumbling, but
		make yourself useful.&#8217; Saying this, he trudged rapidly on, dragging
		the old man with him.</p>

		<p>What passed between him and Jacob, or what took place between
		Ned and Kate, I cannot say; but they certainly were the two tardiest
		people that ever walked; for long after Harson and Rhoneland had
		reached the end of their journey, and stood waiting in front of Rhoneland&#8217;s
		door, they were not in sight; and when they did at last appear,
		it seemed a perfect eternity before they were within calling distance;
		and then even longer before they reached to the door. And although
		from the pace at which they had come, it might have been argued that
		one or the other of them was laboring under extreme debility or fatigue,
		yet it was a remarkable fact, that the looks of neither justified such a
		conclusion; for Kate appeared uncommonly lively and buoyant, and
		Ned seemed as if he only required two fiddlers and a tambourine to
		perform his part in an imaginary quadrille in the street.</p>

		<p>&#8216;What idlers you are!&#8217; exclaimed Harry, as they came up! &#8216;As
		for you,&#8217; said he, turning to Ned, &#8216;such a loiterer should be trusted to
		escort no one unless it were his grandmother or a rheumatic old lady
		of seventy.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Ned Somers laughed, as he answered: &#8216;We don&#8217;t all walk as rapidly
		as you do.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;The more shame for you,&#8217; exclaimed Harson. &#8216;Upon my life! I
		believe I&#8217;m younger than any of you. Look to yourself, my lad, or
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page381" name="page381"></a>381</span>I may take it into my head to cut you out of a wife; and if you lose
		her, you won&#8217;t require the snug little legacy which I intend to leave
		you when I&#8217;m under ground. Come; shake hands with the girl, and
		bid her good night: you&#8217;ve kept her in the street long enough. Good
		night, Jacob&#8212;Good night, Kate.&#8217;</p>

		<p>He took her hand, and whispered, &#8216;Be of good heart; your father
		is coming round.&#8217;</p>

		<p>His mouth was very near her ear; and as he whispered, Ned happened
		to be looking at them, and thought that the communication did
		not stop with the whisper; and Harson himself looked very wickedly
		up at him, as much as to say: &#8216;Do you see that?&#8212;you had better have
		a sharp eye to your interests!&#8217;</p>

		<p>Long and earnest was the conversation which ensued between Harson
		and Somers on their way home; and nobly did the character of that
		old man shine out, as he detailed his future views for his young friend&#8217;s
		welfare.</p>

		<p>&#8216;You need not thank me,&#8217; said he, in reply to Ned&#8217;s warm acknowledgments.
		&#8216;The best return that I can have will be, to find you
		always in word and deed such that I may be proud of you; and hereafter,
		when I see others looking up to you, and hear you spoken of as
		one whose character is above all reproach, that I may say to myself:
		&#8216;Thank God, I helped to make him what he is.&#8217; This is all that I want,
		Ned; and your future life will be your best acknowledgment, or will
		prove your heartless ingratitude. Let neither success nor failure tempt
		you to swerve from what your own heart tells you to be right and fair.
		Turn out as your schemes may, never forget to keep your motives pure;
		and believe me, that come what will, you&#8217;ll find an easy conscience a
		great comforter in the hour of trial. Your father was one of my oldest
		friends; a noble upright man he was; and it would have wounded him
		deeply that any one belonging to him should have been otherwise; and it
		would give me many a heavy hour if his only child did not turn out
		all that I expect him to be. I am right glad to learn that you are
		getting bravely on in your business; and as for this matter with Kate,&#8217;
		said he, pausing, for they had come to where their routes separated, &#8216;it
		can easily be made right. I love her as my own child; and I would
		not have her thwarted for the world. I&#8217;ll see Jacob again to-morrow;
		and have no doubt that he will give his consent at last. Perhaps it
		would be better for you not to present yourself at his house too soon.
		Work your way back to where you were, cautiously, and say nothing
		to him about marrying Kate, until you and he are on your old terms of
		good fellowship. It wont be long, depend on it: and now, recollect what
		I told you a few moments ago. If you want any assistance in your
		business, or if a loan of a thousand or two dollars, or a good word from
		me, will push you on, you shall have it. Good night!&#8217; And Harson
		had not gone a hundred yards, before he was whistling so loud that he
		might have been heard half a mile.</p>

		<p>&#8216;God help you, Harry!&#8217; muttered Somers, looking after the stout,
		burly figure of his friend; &#8216;God bless your warm old heart! What a
		glorious world this would be, if there were more in it like you!&#8217;</p>

		<h2 class="title">LITERARY NOTICES.</h2>
		<p class="work_reviewed"><span class="special_name">Narrative of the Texan Santa Fe Expedition</span>: Comprising a description of a Tour through
		Texas, and across the great South-western prairies, the Camanche and CaygÃ¼a Hunting-grounds,
		with an account of the suffering from want of food, losses from hostile Indians, and final capture of
		the Texans, and their march as prisoners to the city of Mexico. By <span class="special_name">George Wilkins Kendall</span>.
		In two volumes. New-York: <span class="special_name">Harper and Brothers</span>.</p>

		<p><span class="first_word">This</span> is by far the most racy and interesting book of travels we have read for a long
		time. Every body is of course acquainted with the general history of the expedition; its
		romantic projects, its speedy defeat, and the calamitous sufferings which its members were
		forced to undergo. But ill-fated as it was, the rich and most amusing personal incident
		with which every step of its progress appears from this book to have been crowded, commends
		it most forcibly to our admiration. We cannot say that we should have been quite
		willing to accompany our friend <span class="special_name">Kendall</span> through all the severities of his adventurous
		journey; nor can we refuse our sincere sympathy with him and his brave companions, in
		the terrible scenes through which they passed. But he has told all these adventures in so
		pleasing and interesting a manner, and has so sprinkled through the narrative sketches of
		personal incident, abounding with wit and humor, that the volumes must be read with a
		delight as keen as the sufferings recorded were real and severe. Mr. <span class="special_name">Kendall</span> writes in
		a style admirably adapted to the narration of just such a history as he has given; it is simple
		and clear, aiming at nothing more than to give a plain statement of actual occurrences;
		and yet it is remarkably spirited, and distinguished at times by great felicity of expression.
		He is a capital traveller, never shrinking from any danger or difficulty, close in his observation,
		and gifted with a love of fun, and a &#8216;touch&#8217; of humor which no extremity, however
		terrible or threatening, can wholly repress. The reader of the work must be continually
		surprised at the repeated instances which occur where this disposition is strongly manifested;
		and while it must have relieved to a considerable degree the sufferings which he
		was forced to undergo, it gives to the book increased and attractive interest. We should
		be glad to follow Mr. <span class="special_name">Kendall</span> through his journey, and present copious extracts from the
		account he has given of its progress and incidents; but this our limits will not allow; and
		we can only glance at the general history of the expedition, and copy a tithe of the passages
		we have marked in reading the two excellent volumes he has given us.</p>

		<p>At the opening of his book, Mr. <span class="special_name">Kendall</span> gives us a statement of the motives which induced
		him to join the expedition, and an introduction to the persons of whom it was composed.
		His purposes, of course, were entirely pacific, growing out of a desire to recruit his
		health, a wish to procure new materials for writing, and a love of adventure in general.
		He took care to provide himself with passports from the Mexican authorities, which he
		naturally supposed would protect him, as an American citizen, from molestation and injury.
		The first part of their journey led them over the vast prairies and hunting grounds of Western
		Texas; and their adventurous progress is admirably sketched in his flowing narrative.
		Their exploits in hunting buffalo; their frights from, and encounters with, the wild Indians;
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page383" name="page383"></a>383</span>their serenades from the wolves, and all the incidents by which a journey of so large a
		troop over ground before almost untrodden, would naturally be distinguished, are most
		graphically and humorously described. We copy the following interesting description of a
		<i>stampede</i>, or flight of terror, with which great numbers of horses or oxen are sometimes
		seized, with a humorous sketch of the exploits in this line, of one of the nags of the expedition:</p>

		<div class="quotation">
			<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">Nothing</span> can exceed the grandeur of the scene when a large <i>cavallada</i>, or drove of horses, takes
			a &#8216;scare.&#8217; Old, weather-beaten, time-worn, and broken-down steeds&#8212;horses that have nearly given
			out from hard work and old age&#8212;will at once be transformed into wild and prancing colts. When
			first seized with that indescribable terror which induces them to fly, they seem to have been suddenly
			endowed with all the attributes of their original wild nature. With heads erect, tails and manes
			streaming in air, eyes lit up and darting beams of fright, old and jaded hacks will be seen prancing
			and careering about with all the buoyancy of action which characterizes the antics of young colts;
			then some one of the drove, more frightened than the rest, will dash off in a straight line, the rest
			scampering after him, and apparently gaining fresh fears at every jump. The throng will then
			sweep along the plain with a noise which may be likened to something between a tornado and an
			earthquake, and as well might feeble man attempt to arrest either of the latter.</p>

			<p>&#8216;Were the earth rending and cleaving beneath their feet, horses, when under the terryfying influence
			of a <i>stampede</i>, could not bound away with greater velocity or more majestic beauty of movement.
			I have seen many an interesting race, but never any thing half so exciting as the flight of a
			drove of frightened horses. The spectator, who may possibly have a nag among them which he has
			been unable to get into a canter by dint of spur and whip, sees his property fairly flying away at a
			pace that a thorough-bred racer might envy. Better &#8216;time,&#8217; to all appearance, he has never seen
			made, and were it not that he himself is as much astounded as the horses, there might be very pretty
			betting upon the race.</p>

			<p>&#8216;On one occasion, when a closely-hobbled horse was rushing madly along the prairie under the influence
			of fright, his owner coolly remarked: &#8216;I wish I could make that critter go as fast on my own
			account without hobbles, as he can on his own with them&#8212;I&#8217;d gamble on him <em>sure</em>.&#8217; And so it is.
			No simile can give the reader a fair conception of the grandeur of the spectacle, and the most graphic
			arrangement of words must fall far short in describing the startling and imposing effect of a regular
			<i>stampede</i>!</p>

			<p>&#8216;While upon this subject, I should not, perhaps, neglect to notice one of the little private <i>stampedes</i>
			my friend Falconer&#8217;s horse was in the habit of occasionally getting up, principally on his own individual
			account and to gratify his own peculiar tastes and desires, entirely regardless, all the while, of
			his master&#8217;s convenience as well as of the public safety.</p>

			<p>&#8216;He was a short, thick-set, scrubby, wiry nag, tough as a pine knot, and self-willed as a pig. He
			was moreover exceedingly lazy, as well as prone to have his own way, and take his own jog&#8212;preferring
			a walk or gentle trot to a canter; and so deep-rooted were his prejudices in favor of the
			former methods of getting over the ground, that neither whip nor spur could drive him from them.
			He possessed a commendable faculty of taking most especial good care of himself, which he manifested
			by being always found where water was nearest and the grass best, and on the whole might be
			termed, in the language of those who consider themselves judges of horse flesh, a &#8216;tolerable chunk
			of a pony&#8217; for a long journey.</p>

			<p>&#8216;He had one bad quality however, which was continually putting his master to serious inconvenience,
			and on more than one occasion came near resulting seriously to all. One day we stopped to
			&#8216;noon&#8217; close by a spring of water, and had simply taken the bridles from our horses to give them a
			chance to graze, when he improved the occasion to show off one of his eccentricities. Falconer had
			a way, as I have before stated, of packing all his scientific, cooking, and other instruments upon his
			horse, and on the occasion to which I have alluded, some one of them chanced to chafe or gall the
			pony, inducing him to give a kick up with his hinder limbs. The rattling of the pots and pans started
			him off immediately, and the faster he ran the more they rattled. We immediately secured our
			horses by catching up the <i>lariats</i>, and then watched the fanciful antics of the animal that had raised
			all the commotion.</p>

			<p>&#8216;He would run about ten jumps and then stop and kick up about as many times; then he would
			shake himself violently, and then start off again on a gallop. Every now and then a culinary or scientific
			instrument would be detached from its fastenings, when the infuriated pony would manage to
			give it a kick before it struck the ground and send it aloft again. The quadrant took the direction
			toward the sun without taking it; the saucepan was kicked into a stew; the thermometer was up to
			an hundred&#8212;inches above the ground, and fell to&#8212;worth nothing. To sum it all up, what with
			rearing, pitching, kicking, and galloping about, the pony was soon rid of saddle and all other incumbrances,
			and then went quietly to feeding, apparently well satisfied with all the trouble he had given
			his owner.</p>

			<p>&#8216;The whole affair was ludicrous in the extreme, defying description. The rattling of the tin,
			earthen, and other ware, as the pony snorted, kicked, and pranced about, made a noise resembling
			that produced at a <i>charivari</i>. His antics were of the most unseemly nature, too&#8212;and the cool philosophy
			of Mr. Falconer, as he quietly followed in the wake of the vicious animal, picking up the
			fragments scattered along, completed a picture which would have made the fortune of Cruikshank,
			had he been on the spot to take it down. Some time after this adventure the Indians stole the horse,
			but they made a bad bargain of it.&#8217;</p>

		<p>There are scores of passages, describing the burning of a prairie, hunting buffaloes, fighting
		the Indians, camping out at night under a deluge of rain, and other scenes by which
		their journey was marked; but we must pass to the following account of the feelings which
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page384" name="page384"></a>384</span>attend starvation, which we copy for its intrinsic interest, and as an instance of the fearful
		extremities to which the expedition was sometimes reduced:</p>

		<div class="quotation">
			<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">I have</span> never yet seen a treatise on dissertation upon starving to death; I can speak <em>feelingly</em> of
			nearly every stage except the last. For the first two days through which a strong and healthy man
			is doomed to exist upon nothing, his sufferings are, perhaps, more acute than in the remaining stages;
			he feels an inordinate, unappeasable craving at the stomach, night and day. The mind runs upon
			beef, bread, and other substantials; but still, in a great measure, the body retains its strength. On
			the third and fourth days, but especially on the fourth, this incessant craving gives place to a sinking
			and weakness of the stomach, accompanied by nausea. The unfortunate sufferer still desires food,
			but with loss of strength he loses that eager craving which is felt in the earlier stages. Should he
			chance to obtain a morsel or two of food, as was occasionally the case with us, he swallows it with a
			wolfish avidity; but five minutes afterward his sufferings are more intense than ever. He feels as if
			he had swallowed a living lobster, which is clawing and feeding upon the very foundation of his
			existence. On the fifth day his cheeks suddenly appear hollow and sunken, his body attenuated, his
			color an ashy pale, and his eye wild, glassy, cannibalish. The different parts of the system now war
			with each other. The stomach calls upon the legs to go with it in quest of food: the legs, from very
			weakness, refuse. The sixth day brings with it increased suffering, although the pangs of hunger are
			lost in an overpowering languor and sickness. The head becomes giddy; the ghosts of well-remembered
			dinners pass in hideous procession through the mind. The seventh day comes, bringing increased
			lassitude and farther prostration of strength. The arms hang listlessly, the legs drag heavily.
			The desire for food is still left, to a degree, but it must be brought, not sought. The miserable remnant
			of life which still hangs to the sufferer is a burden almost too grievous to be borne; yet his inherent
			love of existence induces a desire still to preserve it, if it can be saved without a tax upon
			bodily exertion. The mind wanders. At one moment he thinks his weary limbs cannot sustain him
			a mile&#8212;the next, he is endowed with unnatural strength, and if there he a certainty of relief before
			him, dashes bravely and strongly onward, wondering whence proceeds this new and sudden impulse.</p>

			<p>&#8216;Farther than this, my experience runneth not. The reader may think I have drawn a fancy
			sketch&#8212;that I have colored the picture too highly: now, while I sincerely trust he may never be in
			a situation to test its truth from actual experience, I would in all sober seriousness say to him, that
			many of the sensations I have just described I have myself experienced, and so did the ninety-and-eight
			persons who were with me from the time when we first entered the grand prairie until we
			reached the flock of sheep, to which more pleasing subject I will now return.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The history of the base betrayal of the party to the Mexicans by one of their members
		named <span class="special_name">Lewis</span>, gives us a picture of Mexican duplicity most vivid and striking: but it is
		only the prelude to cruelties more barbarous and revolting than have recently stained the
		acts of any but the most savage and uncultivated natives. After being disarmed, under
		pretence that it was only a formality, and then promised that their arms would be at once
		restored, they were seized and ordered to be <em>shot</em>; but from this they were saved by the
		interference of one of the Mexican officers less blood-thirsty than the rest. They were immediately
		started off for Santa FÃ©, half-starving and worn down by fatigue, and heard the
		bloody order given to the armed guard which attended them: &#8216;If any one of them pretends
		to be sick or tired on the road, &#8216;<em>Shoot him down and bring back his ears.</em>&#8217;&#8217; The following
		extracts describe some of the scenes they were forced to witness:</p>

		<div class="quotation">
			<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">A walk</span>, or rather a hobble of two hours, for we were so stiff and foot-sore that we could not walk,
			brought us once more to the plaza or public square of San Miguel. The place was now literally
			filled with armed men&#8212;a few regular troops being stationed immediately about the person of Armijo,
			while more than nine-tenths of the so-called soldiers were miserably deficient in every military appointment.
			A sergeant&#8217;s guard of the regular troops was immediately detailed to take charge of our
			little party, and after bidding adieu to Don Jesus, as we hoped forever, we were marched to a small
			room adjoining the soldiers&#8217; quarter. This room fronted on the plaza, and had a small window looking
			out in that direction; but the only entrance was from a door on the side. Sentinels were immediately
			placed at the little window and door, leading us to suppose that this was to be our regular prison-house;
			but we had scarcely been there ten minutes before a young priest entered at the door, and
			said that one of our party was to be immediately shot! While gazing at each other with looks of
			eager inquiry, wondering that one was to be shot and not all, and while each one of us was earnestly
			and painfully speculating on the question which of his fellows Armijo had singled out for a victim,
			the young priest raised himself on tiptoe, and looking over our heads, pointed through the windows
			of our close and narrow prison. We hurriedly turned our eyes in that direction, and were shocked
			at seeing one of our men, his hands tied behind his back, while a bandage covered his eyes, led across
			the plaza by a small guard of soldiers. Who the man was we could not ascertain at the time, but
			that he was one of the Texans was evident enough from his dress. The priest said that he had first
			been taken prisoner, that while attempting to escape he had been retaken, and was now to suffer
			death. A horrible death it was, too! His cowardly executioners led him to a house near the same
			corner of the square we were in, not twenty yards from us, and after heartlessly pushing him upon
			his knees, with his head against the wall, six of the guard stepped back about three paces, and at
			the order of the corporal <em>shot the poor fellow in the back</em>! Even at that distance the executioners
			but half did their barbarous work; for the man was only wounded, and lay writhing upon the ground
			in great agony. The corporal stepped up, and with a pistol ended his sufferings by shooting him
			through the heart. So close was the pistol that the man&#8217;s shirt was set on fire, and continued to burn
			until it was extinguished by his blood!</p>

			<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page385" name="page385"></a>385</span>&#8216;Howland&#8217;s hands were tied closely behind him, and as he approached us we could plainly see that
			his left ear and cheek had been cut entirely off, and that his left arm was also much hacked, apparently
			by a sword. The guard conducted their doomed prisoner directly by us on the left, and when within
			three yards of us the appearance of his scarred cheek was ghastly; but as he turned his head to
			speak, a placid smile, as of heroic resignation to his fate, lit up the other side of his face, forming
			a contrast almost unearthly. We eagerly stepped forward to address him, but the miscreants who
			had charge of us pushed us back with their muskets, refusing even the small boon of exchanging a
			few words with an old companion now about to suffer an ignominious death. Howland saw and felt
			the movement on our part. He turned upon us another look, a look full of brave resolution as well
			as resignation, and, in a low but distinct tone, uttered: &#8216;<em>Good-bye, boys; I&#8217;ve got to suffer. You
			must&#8212;&#8212;</em>&#8217; But the rest of the sentence died on his lips, for he was now some yards in the rear of
			us, and out of hearing.</p>

			<p>&#8216;The guard who had charge of us now wheeled us round, and marched us in the same route taken
			by our unfortunate guide, and within ten yards of him. A more gloomy procession cannot be imagined.
			With Howland in advance, we were now conducted to the plaza, and halted close by the spot
			where, in plain sight, lay the body of our recently-murdered companion. A bandage was placed
			over the eyes of the new victim, but not until he had seen the corpse of his dead comrade. Worlds
			would we have given could we be permitted to exchange one word with our unoffending friend&#8212;to
			receive his last, dying request&#8212;yet even this poor privilege was denied us. After the cords which
			confined his arms had been tightened, and the bandage pulled down so as to conceal the greater part
			of his face, Howland was again ordered to march. With a firm, undaunted step he walked up to the
			place of execution, and there, by the side of his companion, was compelled to fall upon his knees
			with his face towards the wall. Six of the guard then stepped back a yard or two, took deliberate
			aim at his back, and before the report of their muskets died away poor Howland was in eternity!
			Thus fell as noble, as generous, and as brave a man as ever walked the earth.&#8217;</p>
		</div>

		<p>The following passage narrates another barbarity of the same character:</p>

		<div class="quotation">
			<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">Just</span> as we were starting, a man named John McAllister, a native of Tennessee and of excellent
			family, complained that one of his ankles was badly sprained, and that it was utterly impossible for
			him to walk. The unfortunate man was naturally lame in the other ankle, and could never walk but
			with difficulty and with a limp. On starting, he was now allowed to enter a rude Mexican cart,
			which had been procured by the Alcalde of Valencia for the purpose of transporting some of the sick
			and lame prisoners; but before it had proceeded a mile upon the road it either broke down or was
			found to be too heavily loaded. At all events, McAllister was ordered by Salazar to hobble along as
			best he might, and to overtake the main body of prisoners, now some quarter of a mile in advance.
			The wretch had frequently told those who, from inability or weakness, had fallen behind, that he
			would shoot them rather than have the march delayed; not that there was any necessity for the hot
			haste with which we were driven, but to gratify his brutal disposition did he make these threats.
			Although he had struck, and in several cases severely beaten, many of the sick and lame prisoners,
			we could not believe that he was so utterly destitute of feeling, so brutal, as to murder a man in cold
			blood whose only fault was that he was crippled and unable to walk. He could easily have procured
			transportation for all if he had wished, and that he would do so rather than shoot down any of the
			more unfortunate we felt confident: how much we mistook the man!</p>

			<p>&#8216;On being driven from the cart, McAllister declared his inability to proceed on foot. Salazar drew
			his sword and peremptorily ordered him to hurry on, and this when he had half a dozen led mules,
			upon either of which he could have placed the unfortunate man. Again McAllister, pointing to his
			swollen and inflamed ankle, declared himself unable to walk. Some half a dozen of his comrades
			were standing around him, with feelings painfully wrought up, waiting the <i>dÃ©nouement</i> of an affair
			which, from the angry appearance of Salazar, they now feared would be tragical. Once more the
			bloodthirsty savage, pointing to the main body of prisoners, ordered the cripple to hurry forward and
			overtake them&#8212;<em>he could not</em>! &#8216;Forward!&#8217; said Salazar, now wrought up to a pitch of phrenzy.
			&#8216;Forward, or I&#8217;ll shoot you on the spot!&#8217; &#8216;Then shoot!&#8217; replied McAllister, throwing off his blanket
			and exposing his manly breast, &#8216;and the quicker the better!&#8217; Salazar took him at his word, and a
			single ball sent as brave a man as ever trod the earth to eternity! His ears were then cut off, his
			shirt and pantaloons stripped from him, and his body thrown by the roadside as food for wolves!&#8217;</p>
		</div>

		<p>In the following extract, of a different description, we have a sketch of a real &#8216;character:&#8217;</p>

		<div class="quotation">
			<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">Entering</span> an <i>estanquillo</i>, or shop licensed to sell cigars, we met two or three faces so decidedly
			Anglo-Saxon in complexion and feature that we at once accosted them in English, and were answered
			by one of the party with a drawl and twang so peculiarly &#8216;Down East,&#8217; that Marble, Hackett, or
			Yankee Hill, might have taken lessons from him. We soon ascertained that they belonged to the
			American circus company then performing at San Luis, and on telling them who we were, they at
			once invited us to their <i>meson</i> to supper. The first speaker, who proved to be a regular Vermonter,
			was not a little surprised to see us out without a guard, and asked if we had received permission to
			that effect. His astonishment was removed when we told him that we were allowed to leave our
			quarters on parole.</p>

			<p>&#8216;In five minutes after our arrival at the hotel of the equestrians, I found that our Vermont acquaintance
			was one of the quaintest specimens of the Yankee race I had ever seen, and not a few examples
			had I met previous to my encounter with him. He had a droll impediment in his speech which gave
			to his actions and gestures a turn irresistibly comic, and then he told an excellent story, played the
			trombone, triangle, and bass viol, spoke Spanish well, drove one of the circus wagons, translated the
			bills, turned an occasional somerset in the ring, cracked jokes in Spanish with the Mexican clown,
			took the tickets at the entrance with one hand, while with the other he beat an accompaniment to the
			orchestra inside on the bass-drum, and, in short, made himself &#8216;generally useful.&#8217; After partaking of
			an excellent supper, we spent an agreeable hour in his room, listening to story after story of his adventures.
			<span class="pagenum"><a id="page386" name="page386"></a>386</span>He &#8216;come out&#8217; to Mexico, to use his own words, by way of Chihuahua, accompanying the
			traders from Jonesborough, on Red River, in the first and only expedition across the immense prairies.
			They were some six or eight months on the road, and suffered incredible hardships for want of water
			and provisions. Our Yankee was a stout man when we saw him, but he told us that he was a perfect
			transparency when he first arrived at the Mexican settlements&#8212;so poor, in fact, that according to his
			own account, &#8216;a person might have read the New-England Primer through him without specs.&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8216;When ten o&#8217;clock came we rose to depart; but the droll genius insisted that we should first partake
			of a glass of egg-nog with him, and then help him to sing &#8216;Old Hundred&#8217; in remembrance of old
			times. There are few persons in the New-England States who cannot go through this ancient and
			well-known psalm-tune after some fashion; and although neither time nor place was exactly befitting,
			we all happened to be from that quarter, and could not resist complying with his comico-serious
			request. He really had a good voice, and, for aught I know, may have led the singing in his native
			village church. After humming a little, apparently to get the right pitch, he started off with a full,
			rich tone; but suddenly checking himself in the middle of the first line, said that the thing was not
			yet complete. Taking a double-bass from its resting-place in one corner of the room, he soon had
			the instrument tuned, and then recommenced with this accompaniment. Never have I heard a performance
			so strangely mingling the grave and the comic. It was odd enough to see one of his vocation
			in a strange land thus engaged; and then the solemnity and zeal with which he sawed and sang
			away were perfectly irresistible. I did not laugh; but thoughts arose in my mind very little accordant
			with the earnest and devotional spirit with which our strange companion went through his share
			of the performance. This curious scene over, a scene which is probably without a parallel in the
			history of San Luis Potosi, we took leave of our singular acquaintance, who promised to call at the
			convent early the next morning, and do every thing in his power to assist those among the Texans
			who were the most destitute.&#8217;</p>
		</div>

		<p>But we have space only for one more extract, an account of certain &#8216;extra observances,&#8217;
		which, in the order of their devotion, the prisoners while in Puebla, introduced into the
		service of the Catholic church:</p>

		<div class="quotation">
			<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">Every</span> Sunday morning, the prisoners confined at Puebla were compelled to attend mass, in chains,
			at one of the churches. The floors of all the religious establishments of note in Mexico are of stone
			or marble, without seats of any kind, and those in attendance must either kneel or stand during the
			ceremonies. In the present instance, the Texans were paraded in rows before the altar, and compelled
			to fall upon their knees while mass was said; but they were not obliged to go through all the
			little forms and ceremonies which the Catholic Church in Mexico exacts of its votaries, such as crossing
			themselves, smiting their breasts, and other outward observances. Well drilled, however, were
			they in all the minutiÃ¦ of these demonstrations; and in addition, one of the jokers, who had acted as
			the prosecuting attorney at San Cristobal, and who was a great mimic, taught them a few original
			&#8216;extras&#8217; and &#8216;fancy touches,&#8217; which he had ingrafted upon the regular Catholic ceremonials. So well
			had he disciplined his brother prisoners, that they could go through all his ritual with as much
			promptness and precision as could the best military company in existence go through its simplest
			manÅuvres.</p>

			<p>&#8216;On arriving at the church, and after kneeling in front of the altar, the well-drilled Texans awaited
			the usual signal from the officiating priest to commence. There probably was not a Catholic among
			them; yet the assumed air of grave devotion to be seen in their faces would have done credit to the
			most rigid of that creed. At the given signal, and at the proper time, the chained prisoners would
			cross themselves with all seeming humility, closely imitating every motion of the priest and of the
			Mexicans around them; but instead of stopping with their Catholic neighbors, they wound up by
			placing the right thumb to the tip of their noses, and then, with a mock gravity which might have
			drawn a smile from an Egyptian mummy, circled the fingers about, and all this directly in the face of
			the officiating priest, and without a smile upon their countenances. When the proper time came for
			again crossing themselves, the mischievous leader of the Texans would pass the word for his men to
			&#8216;come the double compound action,&#8217; as he called it. This resembled the first movement, with the
			exception that it was more complicated and more mysterious to the surrounding Mexicans. After
			the right hand had gone its usual round, from forehead to breast and from shoulder to shoulder, the
			thumb again settled on the tip of the nose; but this time the left thumb was joined to the little finger
			of the right hand, and then commenced a series of fancy gyrations with all the fingers, the like of
			which was probably never before seen in a Catholic church. Sam Weller, I believe, or if not he,
			some modern philosopher of his school, defines the movement I have just described as meaning
			something like &#8216;This may be all very true, but we don&#8217;t believe a word of it.&#8217; What the Mexicans
			thought of it, or whether they noticed it or not, I am unable to say: it may be that they considered it
			as simply &#8216;a way&#8217; the Texans had, and thought no more of it. Such is the story told of the pranks
			played by the prisoners confined in Puebla.&#8217;</p>

		<p>We must here end our notice of this amusing book. It will be found highly entertaining,
		and to contain also much information concerning the character of the country through
		which Mr. <span class="special_name">Kendall</span> passed. It will attain a wide popularity, for it is decidedly the best
		and most readable book of the season. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">Since</span> the foregoing was placed in type, we
		learn from Mr. <span class="special_name">Kendall&#8217;s</span> journal, the well known New-Orleans &#8216;<i>Picayune</i>,&#8217; that the
		tyrant <span class="special_name">Salazar</span>, whose cruelties are recorded in preceding extracts, met recently with an
		awful death. He escaped from prison at Santa FÃ©, and fled to the woods, where he was
		killed and scalped by the Indians, and his body left a prey to wild beasts. Just retribution!</p>

		Boston: <span class="special_name">The Association.</span></p>

		<p><span class="first_word">The</span> inculcations of both these performances are excellent; and in a literary point of
		view, they are also highly creditable to their authors. Mr. Lincoln supports the necessity
		and dignity of labor with unanswerable argument and felicitous illustrations. Much, says
		he, in a few segregated sentences, &#8216;has been written, with truth and eloquence, by great
		minds, upon the dignity of labor; but it is the dignity of <em>the laborer</em> which is the vital point
		that demands attention. Labor or industry needs no apology, no advocates; it is the very
		instinct of our being, and one of the first to develop itself; it is only when performed in a
		peculiar way, or associated with a particular class, that it is considered disreputable. How
		is this evil to be remedied? Not by assuming a superiority, but by <em>attaining</em> to it. You
		have it in your power to make the profession of a mechanic as honorable as any avocation
		in life. The dignity of a profession depends upon the character of those who are in its
		ranks. If the individual is low or mean, no occupation can confer upon him respectability
		or regard. On the other hand, no useful employment, however trivial, in the social state,
		can degrade him who faithfully performs its duties. It is not always the men of genius,
		those gifted with extraordinary natural endowments, who are the greatest benefactors of
		our race, or who enjoy in a greater degree personal happiness themselves. <span class="special_name">Washington</span>
		and <span class="special_name">Franklin</span> were not men of genius, as the world understands that term. It was by
		probity, industry, perseverance, a well-strung nerve, and an iron will, that they conquered
		the obstacles before them, and acquired that true greatness which has made their names
		preÃ«minent among the famous of earth, and their example the inspiration of American
		youth. Circumstances may do something for us; we can do more for ourselves. We must
		have faith, we must be in earnest.&#8217; The healthful American spirit which pervades the

		this performance, commencing &#8216;List to the Psalm of Labor!&#8217; speaks of what we intended
		our readers should have had an opportunity to &#8216;hearken to;&#8217; but the tyranny of space is
		despotic.</p>

		<p><span class="first_word">We</span> have perused these Lectures, as far as they have advanced, not only with unabated

		the Justice who committed him to his twelve years&#8217; imprisonment, and the Clerk of the
		Peace who came to remonstrate with him for his conscientious &#8216;obstinacy;&#8217; but are compelled
		to omit them for the present. These passages, however, like his entire life, illustrate
		this eloquent sketch of Mr. <span class="special_name">Cheever</span>:</p>

		<div class="quotation">
			<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">He</span> kept on his course, turning neither to the right hand nor the left, in his <span class="special_name">Master&#8217;s</span> service, but
			he made all ready for the tempest, and familiarized himself to the worst that might come, be it the
			prison, the pillory, or banishment, or death. With a magnanimity and grandeur of philosophy
			which none of the princes or philosophers or sufferers of this world ever dreamed of, he concluded
			that &#8216;the best way to go through suffering, is to trust in <span class="special_name">God</span> through <span class="special_name">Christ</span> as touching the world
			to come; and as touching this world to be dead to it, to give up all interest in it, to have the sentence
			of death in ourselves and admit it, to count the grave my house, to make my bed in darkness, and to
			say to corruption, thou art my father; and to the worm, thou art my mother and sister; that is, to
			familiarize these things to me.&#8217; With this preparation, when the storm suddenly fell, though the
			ship at first bowed and labored heavily under it, yet how like a bird did she afterward flee before it!
			It reminds me of those two lines of Wesley:</p>

			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p class="i6">&#8216;The tempests that rise.</p>
					<p>Shall gloriously hurry our souls to the skies!&#8217;</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>So <span class="special_name">Bunyan&#8217;s</span> bark sped onward, amidst howling gales, with rattling hail and thunder, but onward,
			still onward, and upward, still upward, to heaven!&#8217;</p>

		<h2 class="title">EDITOR&#8217;S TABLE.</h2>
		<div class="ed_table_item">
			<p><span class="ed_table_title">The Inner Life of Man.</span>&#8212;We are indebted to the kindness of an esteemed friend
			who was present at the recent delivery of a lecture before the &#8216;Young Men&#8217;s Society&#8217; of
			Newark, New-Jersey, by Mr. <span class="special_name">Charles Hoover</span>, upon &#8216;<i>The Inner Life of Man</i>,&#8217; for a few
			passages from that admirable performance, which may be relied upon as very nearly identical
			with the language that fell from the lips of the speaker. We cannot but hope, on behalf
			of our citizens, that Mr. <span class="special_name">Hoover</span> may be invited to repeat his lecture in this city.
			Surely, its enlarged views, its benign inculcations, its tender remonstrances, are needed
			among us; nor will the good seed fall altogether upon stony ground, nor be utterly choked
			by the tares that abound in our field of bustling and busy existence. &#8216;But what,&#8217; the reader
			may ask, &#8216;is this inner, higher life, concerning which we hear so much in these latter
			days?&#8217; Let Mr. <span class="special_name">Hoover</span> make answer: &#8216;<span class="first_word">It</span> is that ethereal, spiritual nature, which by an
			incarnation only less mysterious than that of the <span class="special_name">Son</span> of <span class="special_name">God</span>, is in present temporary alliance
			and partnership with our animal nature; which, itself imperishable and immortal,
			measures the cycle of its probation burthened with a dead body. It is that in man which
			loves the beautiful and the good, which expands and warms to the breathing and the voice
			of love; which, like the child listening to the murmuring sea-shell, catches the far-off
			sound of the solemn future, and hears celestial harmonies in silentest hours. It is that
			which in infancy gathers in its first excursion the stuff that infant dreams are made of;
			which in childhood makes the welkin ring with joy and laughter, crowns itself with flowers,
			and arches life and the world, and all inaccessible things and places, with airy bridges;
			which sees angel-forms in flitting clouds, and in the gorgeous glory of setting suns beholds
			the vestibule and drapery of other worlds: which holds communion with flowers as things
			of life, and with birds as beautiful and gentle friends; which rebounds like a liberated bow
			from the touch of grief to the freedom of joy, and sees in its own tear-drop a perfect rainbow.
			To the inner life of man, in its gradual and successive unfoldings, belong those deep
			musings of the heart, which suggested perhaps by trifles light as air, become mighty, like
			pent-up fires in a mountain&#8217;s bosom, and tossing off the superincumbent pressure, burst
			forth in a flame of patriotism to unyoke a nation, or in heroic religious love to bless a world.
			In the inner life of man are born and nurtured those deep and intense affections which
			make a man willing to die for his country, his faith, and his friends; which purified, lift
			him up an angel; which poisoned, burn to hell, and turn him into a fiend; there rise the
			fountains of generous sensibility; there dawn hope and love, and reverence and faith;
			there yearn the immortal desires of continued existence and eternal joy; there is the chamber
			of prophetic visions and poetic fires; there conscience holds its court, and in God&#8217;s
			stead utters its solemn decision. There too the acutest of our sensibilities to suffering reside.
			<span class="omitted_text">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">And</span> this inner, spiritual nature of man is his distinguishing glory, the priceless,
			<span class="pagenum"><a id="page390" name="page390"></a>390</span>inalienable treasure which he carries with him amid all the changes of time, and all
			the disasters of the universe. It is his all. It is his proper self. Other things are circumstances
			of his being. This is his being, subsisting independently of every other thing and
			being except the <span class="special_name">Deity</span>. It invests all external objects with its own character and coloring;
			paints its own image on the sky, the floods, the fields, and faces of men, and turns
			the world into a thousand-faced mirror, and every face flings back upon the soul its own
			likeness, and all its flitting, changeful phases of mood and feeling. Is it guilty? &#8216;The fiends
			of its own bosom people air with kindred fiends that hunt it to despair.&#8217; Is it sad? The
			sighing of the softest breeze is heard as a requiem, and the natural beatings of its own heart
			sound like &#8216;funeral marches and muffled drums.&#8217; Is it glad, innocent, and happy? All
			nature smiles and puts on the garments of beauty; the stars sing together, the trees of the
			forest rejoice, and the floods clap their hands. Thus the visible universe becomes a mere
			reproduction of the spirit of man that beholds it. Create a mind, and it creates for its residence
			an external world of its own hue and character. Make that mind happy, and its
			external world, from pole to pole and from the zenith to its centre, is resplendent with light
			and beauty; balm-like airs, soft and fragrant as those of uncursed Eden, breathe upon it,
			and all its life is love. Dreaming, it sees a ladder reaching to heaven, and the angels of
			<span class="special_name">God</span> ascending and descending on errands of mercy, and waking, exclaims with reverential
			joy, &#8216;Surely <span class="special_name">God</span> is in this place.&#8217; Make a mind miserable, and you darken its universe.
			The stars fall from its heaven, the golden fruitage of its paradise decays, and winter winds
			wail around it, and night and storm mingle their pitiless elements on its unsheltered head.
			Intertwined and involved in the inner life, are occurring at all times the great things of
			human history. In the sanctuary of unrevealed bosoms, in the &#8216;silent, secret sessions&#8217; of
			thought, and in the glow of individual feeling, in the field, at the fire-side, in the closet, or
			on the sleepless bed, there is man&#8217;s history: there, unfolding to act, or infolding itself to
			die, the soul is in its greatness, is in labor with itself, and struggling with big, burning
			thoughts, and &#8216;truths that wake to perish never;&#8217; decreeing with solemn form and force
			what is to be done, and what endured. Let no man despise what is revolved in the private
			mind.&#8217;</p>



			<p>We scarcely know which most to admire, the nervous thoughts embodied in the following
			passage, or the fervent and beautiful language in which a just reproof is conveyed:</p>

			<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">In</span> all our wanderings round this world of care, we have been deeply moved and
			amazed at the fact, that down into the world of troubled, sorrowing mind and tortured
			sensibilities, the professors and light-bearers of the religion of <span class="special_name">Jesus</span> have thrown so few
			of its melting beams. Of transcendent mysteries this is not the least, that of those who
			hold to a religion that is comprehended in one burning word, one transforming principle,
			<span class="special_name">Love</span>; which is not a theory, but a divine passion, and whose hopes all rest on the doctrine
			of forgiveness; so few practically and heartily pity, forgive, and love the erring and the
			wretched of the family of man. Oh! it was not thus when <span class="special_name">Pity</span>, eighteen hundred years
			ago, habited as a man, and leaning upon a pilgrim&#8217;s staff, set out from the brow of Nazareth
			to the hill of Calvary, tracing with tearful eye and weary foot the roads of Judea and the
			streets of Jerusalem! <span class="omitted_text">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">In</span> an age which, in sorrow not in anger, in heart-felt regret,
			not in bitterness, we are compelled to regard as extensively pseudo-philanthropic; when a
			vaunting benevolence is current, which hovers every where and alights no where; which
			loves all men in general and no man in particular; profuse of pity to the heathen, while
			bloated with poisonous hate to its neighbor; it is refreshing to see occasional instances of
			practical brotherhood with poor, down-trodden, benumbed and forsaken humanity. That
			is true benevolence, which with mingled faith, reverence, and love, descends in quest of
			the inner life beneath repulsive appearances, and tainted name, and shattered fortune,
			and from the depths brings up a bleeding heart, a scathed soul, and speaks to it of hope
			and consolation, and cheers it up to the purpose of self-recovery, and the recommencement
			of a virtuous life, and the reconstruction of a broken, blasted fame; that rekindles with
			<span class="pagenum"><a id="page391" name="page391"></a>391</span>vestal care its dying fires, and like a pious mother, nurses it through weakness, infirmity,
			irresolution, and despondency, back to hale strength and vigor; that by a generous confidence
			in its earliest repentings, and a generous forgiveness of its gravest faults, lends
			strength to its purposes and permanence to its reform. Oh! there are such hearts all around
			us, still warm and beating, though pierced through with many sorrows, goaded it may be
			at once by a sense of guilt and the horrors of abandonment, yet not dead to virtue, nay,
			sensitively alive to it; &#8216;for as certain flowers open only in the night, so often in the dark
			hours of a great sorrow the human soul first opens to the light of the eternal stars.&#8217; There
			<em>are</em> such hearts buried all around us; and from their unquiet graves come up the low wail,
			the stifled sob, the muttered curse, the anguished prayer, appealing to the thoughtless brotherhood
			above them for a ray of light, and a breath of the free air of heaven! Hearken,
			and ye shall hear the tones of an eternal <i>miserÃ©re</i>, mingling and swelling like distant organ-peals,
			drowned by the din of day-light, but re-heard in all hours of thought and stillness,
			in all places of meditative retirement. Listen, and ye shall hear soliloquies of the heart
			with itself, revealing pleasant memories and hopes, and tendernesses and joys, that come up
			from the past in shadowy troops, with lights and garlands&#8212;and vanish, making the darkness
			more visible and solitude more hideous. Blessed, we say, for Heaven has said it,
			blessed are they whose ministry of love is in that unquiet inner world; whose sympathies
			intertwine themselves with its strained, snapped fibres and ligaments; whose hand gently
			withdraws the barbed arrows of outrageous fortune, and into the ragged wound pours the
			oil of consolation and the balm of joy! Select, sacred, and heaven-ordained and anointed
			priests and priestesses they, of a <span class="special_name">God</span> of love in a world of sorrow. Not their commission
			is it to declare to cowering criminals a <span class="special_name">God</span> wrathful, vindictive, and scarcely less bloody
			than the Druid&#8217;s deity, hating with infinite venom the unhappy violator of his laws; not
			theirs to deal out curious metaphysics and cold abstractions, giving a stone for bread and
			an adder for an egg to the sons of sorrow and the daughters of misfortune; but to inspire
			hope in the desponding and peace in the troubled bosom; to give light for darkness, the
			oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; to bring back
			the lost to their <span class="special_name">Father&#8217;s</span> house, and raise the dead to life again.&#8217;</p>

		</div>
		<div class="ed_table_item">
			<p><span class="ed_table_title">A brace of Pellets from &#8216;Julian</span>.&#8217;&#8212;Not one of our readers, we will venture to
			say, has forgotten the spiritual <span class="special_name">Julian</span>, whose &#8216;Top of New-York,&#8217; and the inquiry concerning
			&#8216;the law&#8217; between man and wife, in regard to getting up first in the morning, attracted
			so much attention and remark two or three months since. We annex two late
			paper-pellets of his brain; and must ask the reader to admire with us the fervent feeling
			of new paternity wreaked upon expression in the first, and the ease and simplicity of style
			which mark the unstudied sketch that succeeds it: &#8216;<span class="first_word">Have</span> you ever any nervous days, my
			kind <span class="special_name">Editor</span>? Nervous, beyond publishing days, or the want of copy; beyond excesses, the
			reaction of excitement, fast-days, and the giving of thanks?&#8212;for these last are animal only,
			and for such, doctors are made and abound every where. The cure for them you may get
			in a brown-paper parcel; it is buyable; and of late it is eatable; you may take it in a
			lozenge. But the days of which I speak are such as you must endure patiently unto the
			end. &#8216;They come like shadows, so depart,&#8217; but the cloud that gives the shadow is beyond
			your reach. A new doubt or apprehension, or an old one with an uglier face than usual;
			a hideousness not before seen, a devilishness of malice flashing upon you for the first time,
			or even an unkind word, added to your previous gathering of matÃ©riel, may tip the balance
			of your pleasant thoughts, and then, all colors changing into one, the black cloud rolls over
			you, and dark thoughts, wholly foreign to your nature, throng round and stab at you, till
			at last, by that old snakish sympathy of excitement, your own dark passions rise and embrace
			<span class="pagenum"><a id="page392" name="page392"></a>392</span>them, and the sensitive guardians of the brain, mingling in the fray, give you up,
			one by one, captive to the devil. In the lighter hours of the day, the dead hopes of the
			Past, the beauties of other days, throng round you, and shake their dry bones; and oh,
			what efforts at sprightliness! what ravishing of graces! what whirling and rattling of
			bare bones, as they waltz round to that music of other days! And now, born of these,
			comes another group, with the laughing eye of young years and a full heart; and ah! the
			tempting lip, the heaving bosom, the light step of the perfect form; ha! ha! there is life,
			there is beauty in the world again! But then will they betray you? Will they grow old
			and ugly? Will they live to mock at you? And now the words, &#8216;No you don&#8217;t, you
			can&#8217;t come it,&#8217; tremble upon your lips; but then, oh! the delight of giving up to it; going
			the whole, the entire, the unclipt, the blind-folded, the universal; &#8216;ha! ha! come to my heart,
			my beauties!&#8217; and with open arms you stagger to their embraces. But in that long, long, kiss,
			with the hot breath of passion, and the bounding blood and brain reeling to madness, there
			is the bitterness of death. <em>Dust and ashes!</em>&#8212;take them away. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">The</span> drop too much
			in all this is, that you get no sympathy from others; it is quite too personal, too exclusive
			for that. Whereas, in the solemnities of New-Year&#8217;s, and in all the concernments of that
			day, the whole world beareth company. Not but that we have occasion for all our bravery,
			our greetings and rejoicings; it is well to affect that, for there is a strange man about town,
			all that day, and a <i>disci mori</i> whispered about the streets; and although we pretend not to
			know, or to hear him, there is one at our house who hath let him in; and all day long is
			he parleying and protesting and offering refreshments, forsooth, to that unwelcome visitor.
			But there is a pleasure in the assurance that the cunning of our neighbors shall not avail
			more than ours with his impertinence; that he shall be stabbed under the fifth rib, that
			he shall wince under his hits, his jokes, his stinging rebuke! There is also something
			companionable in the thought, that we are not alone in this onward movement of years,
			this stern necessity of motion, this tread-mill step! No one can defalcate in this particular;
			no one can Texas-ize and be quit of his transgressions and his onward travel. But millions
			of our own kith and kin travel the same way; England goes with us; Europe goes
			with us; and let not the indolent Turk dream that he is becalmed the while; let not the
			exclusives of the rising sun imagine that they in their nearness to Heaven do not, nevertheless,
			whirl on in the general motion, even as the outer barbarians! Decidedly, they <em>do</em>;
			their somersets avail not, and the edicts of the great Ching-poo are astounded at their non-effect.
			This is one pleasant reflection born of New-Year&#8217;s; beside, it would be amusing, if one
			could laugh at any thing so sad, to observe the humors of the few who think upon the bearings
			of that solemn time. In the year to be, there are many to come, many to go, and but few
			to tarry; yet <em>all</em> have their ambitions of a life-time; those even, to whom the stars have
			grown dim, and life become almost a mockery under Heaven, dashing into the coming
			day with something of the old zest; while the many, the <i>oi polloi</i>, who have not yet made
			their grand move, are now ready, and think that therefore the earth is to take a new route
			in creation; forgetting that the old round must be the round for ever. Nights sleepless with
			joy, nights sleepless with pain, nights long with watching, feverish thought; crime that
			stings like an adder, and nights short with perfect rest; days long and weary, days bright
			and dashing, hot and cold, wet and dry, and days and nights with all of these&#8212;as hath been
			in the time that&#8217;s past, and will be in the time to come.</p>

			<p>&#8216;There is something very pitiable in these humors, Mr. <span class="special_name">Editor</span>; indeed very laughable,
			if your mouth is shaped to that effect; but as it happens with me to-night, my mouth
			refuses to twitch except in one direction. Its corners have what Prof. <span class="keep_together">P&#8212;&#8212;</span> used to call
			the &#8216;downward tendencies.&#8217; Perhaps it is because this is with me the anniversary of a day
			upon the events of which are hanging the movements of all after-life; it may be this, and
			there may be thereto added the coloring of a winter&#8217;s day. The wind howls about the
			house-tops, and the air pierces like needles; even the stars, when they look down in thousands,
			as the rack goes by, seem to shiver in their high places; yet perhaps there is nothing
			so personal in all that, considering that just so the wind howled last night, and may for a
			<span class="pagenum"><a id="page393" name="page393"></a>393</span>month to come; but oh! as I am a nervous man, and look back upon the circling months,
			and feel the sting here and the stab there, in that galvanic battery; and as I look forward
			with eager eye, and ear open to the faintest whisper of the dim to-morrow, it is not as
			the stars shiver from excess of light, but with a shudder at the heart from the cooler blood
			of<span class="keep_together">&#8212;&#8212;</span>Good night, my kind <span class="special_name">Editor</span>; that sentence is quite too long already, and there
			are some things too personal to tell.</p>

			<p class="post_break">&#8216;P. S.&#8212;Whoop! hurrah! Light upon the world again! Where are you, my fine <span class="special_name">Editor</span>?
			I say Sir, I was an ass&#8212;do you hear?&#8212;an <em>ass</em>, premature, wise before my time, a brute,
			a blockhead! Did I talk of dust and ashes? Oh! Sir, I lied multitudinously. Every
			nerve, every muscle that didn&#8217;t try to strangle me in that utterance, <em>lied</em>. No, Sir; let me
			tell you it&#8217;s a great world; glorious&#8212;magnificent; a world that can&#8217;t be beat! Talk of
			the stars and a better world, but don&#8217;t invite me there yet. Make my regrets, my apology
			to Death, but say that I can&#8217;t come; &#8216;positive engagement; happy some other time, but not
			now.&#8217; Oh, no; this morning is quite too beautiful to leave; and beside, I would rather
			stay, if only to thank <span class="special_name">God</span> a little longer for this glorious light, this pure air that can echo
			back my loudest hurrah. And then, my boy&#8212;&#8212;But haven&#8217;t I told you? Why Sir, I&#8217;ve
			got a boy!&#8212;<em>a boy</em>&#8212;ha, ha! I shout it out to you&#8212;<span class="special_emphasis">a Boy</span>; fourteen pounds, and the
			mother a great deal <em>better</em> than could be expected! And I say, Mr. <span class="special_name">Editor</span>, it&#8217;s <em>mine!</em>
			hurrah and hallelujah forever! Oh, Sir! such legs, and such arms, and such a head!&#8212;and
			Oh my <span class="special_name">God</span>! <em>he has his mother&#8217;s lips!</em> I can kiss them forever! And then, Sir, look at his
			feet, his hands, his chin, his eyes, his every thing, in fact&#8212;so &#8216;<em>perfectly O. K.!</em>&#8217; Give me
			joy, Sir; no you needn&#8217;t either. I am full now; I run over; and they say that I ran over
			a number of old women, half killed the mother, pulled the doctor by the nose, and upset a
			&#8217;pothecary-shop in the corner; and then didn&#8217;t I ring the tea-bell? Didn&#8217;t I blow the
			horn? Didn&#8217;t I dance, shout, laugh, and cry altogether? The women say they had to
			tie me up. I don&#8217;t believe <em>that</em>; but who is going to shut his mouth when he has a live baby?
			You should have heard his lungs, Sir, at the first mouthful of fresh air&#8212;such a burst! A
			little tone in his voice, but not pain; excess of joy, Sir, from too great sensation. The
			air-bath was so sudden, you know. Think of all his beautiful machinery starting off at
			once in full motion; all his thousand outside feelers answering to the touch of the cool air;
			the flutter and crash at the ear; and that curious contrivance the eye, looking out wonderingly
			and bewildered upon the great world, so glorious and dazzling to his unworn
			perceptions; his net-work of nerves, his wheels and pulleys, his air-pumps and valves,
			his engines and reservoirs; and within all, that beautiful fountain, with its jets and running
			streams dashing and coursing through the whole length and breadth, without stint,
			or pause&#8212;making altogether, Sir, exactly fourteen pounds!</p>

			<p>&#8216;Did I ever talk brown to you, Sir, or blue, or any other of the devil&#8217;s colors? You say
			I have. Beg your pardon, Sir, but you&#8212;are mistaken in the individual. I am this day,
			Sir, multiplied by two. I am duplicate. I am number one of an indefinite series, and
			there&#8217;s my continuation. And you observe, it is not a block, nor a block-head, nor a
			painting, nor a bust, nor a fragment of any thing, however beautiful; but a combination
			of <em>all</em> the arts and sciences in one; painting, sculpture, music (hear him cry,) mineralogy,
			chemistry, mechanics (see him kick,) geography, and the use of the globes (see him nurse;)
			and withal, he is a perpetual motion&#8212;a time-piece that will never run down! And who
			wound it up? But words, Sir, are but a mouthing and a mockery. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> When a man is
			nearly crushed under obligations, it is presumed that he is unable to speak; but he may
			bend over very carefully, for fear of falling, nod in a small way, and say nothing; and then,
			if he have sufficient presence of mind to lay a hand upon his heart, and look down at an
			angle of forty-five degrees, with a motion of the lips&#8212;unuttered poetry&#8212;showing the wish
			and inability, it will be (well done) very gracefully expressive. With my boy in his first
			integuments, I assume that position, make the small nod aforesaid, and leave you the poetry
			unuttered.&#8217;</p>

			<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page394" name="page394"></a>394</span>&#8216;<span class="first_word">Odd-zounds</span>!&#8217; thought we, on glancing at the subject of the ensuing piscatory epistle,
			&#8216;what can all this outcry mean?&#8217; But that exclamatory query we shall permit <span class="special_name">Julian</span>
			himself to answer, in his own peculiar way:</p>

			<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">Gammon</span>!&#8217; said <span class="special_name">Harry</span>. &#8216;Wait a moment,&#8217; said I; &#8216;I shall throw sixes;&#8217; and to be sure
			down came the sixes, striking him on the &#8216;seize&#8217; point, and then rebounding to my own,
			swept every man from the table. The board was put up, and after a little closing chat
			with Mrs. <span class="keep_together">H&#8212;&#8212;</span>, I was taking leave, when <span class="special_name">Harry</span> called me back. &#8216;<span class="special_name">Julian</span>,&#8217; said he,
			&#8216;Come and breakfast to-morrow upon &#8216;Zounds and Sounds.&#8217;&#8217; &#8216;Zounds and Sounds!&#8217; said I,
			&#8216;I shall be delighted! What a charming dish! I remember of&#8212;&#8212;&#8217; &#8216;And <span class="special_name">Jule</span>,&#8217; said
			<span class="special_name">Harry</span>, interrupting me, &#8216;perhaps <span class="special_name">Fanny</span> would come?&#8217; &#8216;Oh, impossible! you know she
			is delicate yet, and the mornings are quite chilly.&#8217; &#8216;Well, good night; and don&#8217;t forget
			that we breakfast <em>early</em>.&#8217; &#8216;My dear Sir,&#8217; said I, &#8216;I could rise at cock-crow for Zounds and
			Sounds.&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">Now</span>, I had never even heard the words before; but I pique myself on
			knowing strange and choice dishes; not the far-fetched things of the French, but things
			good <i>per se</i>, and without a sea of condiments; the delicate, the rare subtleties which our
			own women know so well to compound. Of course, I <em>ought</em> to know Zounds and Sounds,
			and of course, I should not hurry to disclaim that knowledge. <span class="special_name">Harry</span> might have known,
			and then again he might <em>not</em>; but he remembered, as I have since ascertained, of having
			eaten something of the kind some thirty years since; something he had perhaps cloyed of,
			and so forgotten, but something very delectable; something that would perhaps touch his
			palate again like the maple-sugar and other dainties of his boyhood. Having found the
			article that day, he had secured a large quantity without asking what they were, and had
			them taken privately to his house, with a view of making up the dish himself. I came home,
			rolling the magic words &#8216;as a sweet morsel under my tongue,&#8217; and immediately sought
			out a curious dictionary, in which various strange things are expounded; and failing in
			that, looked into <span class="special_name">Crabbe&#8217;s</span> Synonymes, (by the rule of contraries, I suppose, for there certainly
			could be nothing <em>like</em> Zounds and Sounds,) but as <span class="special_name">Longfellow</span> says, &#8216;All in vain!&#8217;
			<span class="special_name">Fanny</span> having retired, I got into my slippers and sat down by the fire to ruminate a little.
			&#8216;Zounds and Sounds!&#8217; said I. &#8216;What an incomparable phrase! What a sweet suffusion
			of the z! What vibratory tingling upon the tympanum! How pleasantly percussive to the
			brain; and how even the teeth partake of the sensation! I declare! I must write a song
			upon Zounds and Sounds! I will. I will write an invitatory song to the <span class="special_name">Editor</span>. Let
			me see. Zounds, rounds, bounds and hounds. Exactly! Now then:</p>

			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p><span class="first_word">Are</span> you weary Sir, of the ups and downs</p>

			<p>Finishing the song, I looked about for my flute to find a tune for it, but reflecting that I
			should wake the house, put it by again for another time. &#8216;After all,&#8217; said I, &#8216;a flute
			couldn&#8217;t touch that <i>z</i> sound. Indeed what can? What is there like it? Has a church-bell
			any tone approximating it even? Has a violin? Has a hautboy? Has a French horn?
			Has a jew&#8217;s-harp? Ay, that&#8217;s the thing! A Jew&#8217;s-harp has something like it; and so&#8212;so
			<span class="pagenum"><a id="page395" name="page395"></a>395</span>has a bumble-bee. A thought strikes me! It is possible that Zounds and Sounds are&#8212;Yes,&#8217;
			said I, rising and shouting with the excitement, &#8216;Zounds and Sounds are <em>bumble-bees!</em>&#8212;bumble-bees
			curiously prepared; gathered in some warm climate where they
			abound, and pickled! Henceforth let no man call that bee &#8216;humble;&#8217; he is <em>bumble</em>, most
			decidedly!&#8217; And with this thought I hurried off to bed. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> It may have been an hour
			afterward, while I was in the maze between sleeping and waking, that the words &#8216;Zounds
			and Sounds&#8217; escaped me, unawares. &#8216;What&#8217;s that?&#8217; said <span class="special_name">Fanny</span>, starting up. &#8216;Are you
			sure that I spoke?&#8217; said I. &#8216;Indeed, I am; you said something about going down town.&#8217;
			&#8216;Did I? Well, I forgot to tell you. I <em>am</em> going down town; so you must not be surprised
			at my rising early to-morrow. I think of breakfasting out.&#8217; &#8216;You think! I should think
			you did; thinking aloud, and asleep too! Don&#8217;t think so again, dear; you woke me out
			of a sound sleep.&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">At</span> an early hour the next morning, I was at my friend&#8217;s house.
			<em>How</em> I got there, I do not now remember; but I have a distinct recollection of a ringing sensation
			in my head, and of not being quite sure that I was awake, till the romping of a dozen
			children, and a buzzing sound every where of Zounds and Sounds aroused me to a full
			sense of the great treat that was coming. Then it was that I sang the last night&#8217;s song,
			and it took immensely, especially with the children. <span class="special_name">Harry</span> was not there to hear it, and
			lost that pleasure, (as I have never repeated it,) unless he heard it in the kitchen, where
			he was superintending the burden of the song. Shortly after, came the call of &#8216;breakfast,&#8217;
			and we all walked in, at least fifteen of us, and took seats at the table before the Zounds
			and Sounds were brought in. <span class="special_name">Harry</span> was already seated at the head. Presently the
			Zounds came in, piping hot; but before they had reached the table, <span class="special_name">Harry</span> turned to me
			and asked if I had any preference. &#8216;Have you taken the stingers out?&#8217; said I, thinking
			of bumble-bees. &#8216;Stingers!&#8217; said <span class="special_name">Harry</span>. &#8216;Oh, I beg your pardon,&#8217; said I; &#8216;only a joke;&#8217;
			and making a bold guess at some white things that now appeared on the table, added, &#8216;A
			little of the breast.&#8217; <span class="special_name">Harry</span> smiled, but said nothing. Plates were now served all around.
			Breakfast went on, and Zounds and Sounds went down, and every body appeared to be
			perfectly charmed with the dish. One might say, to be sure, that they were a little saltish,
			and then again, with that exception, there was no remarkable flavor; but that might be
			the rarity, <em>not to have any flavor</em>. No one, however, thought <em>aloud</em> in this manner. On the
			contrary, there was a manifest inclination to detect resemblances of taste and flavor to
			those of very many rare and delicate cookeries; but after awhile <em>there came a pause</em>. It
			was during this pause, that my friend turned to his wife and inquired if she was quite sure
			they were seasoned properly. &#8216;I think they are a little salt,&#8217; said Mrs. <span class="keep_together">H&#8212;&#8212;;</span> but, my
			dear, you know you prepared them yourself.&#8217; <span class="special_name">Harry</span> looked thunder-clouds, and called
			one of the servants. &#8216;Mary,&#8217; said he, &#8216;take the key and bring me a <em>raw Zound</em>. You will
			find two buckets-full in the wine-cellar.&#8217; Wondering at this, we wondered still more at
			finding our coffee-cups all empty at the same time. Each one was waiting for <em>drink</em>. The
			raw Zound was now brought, and <span class="special_name">Harry</span>, plunging his fork into it, while all eyes were
			fixed upon him, turned it over and over, examining it on all sides, and then, with his arm
			at a right angle, raised it deliberately to his nose. Almost instantaneously, and while still
			some distance off, there came a very wise expression about his nostrils, which, as the Zound
			came nearer, dilated still more and more, deepening the expression to a frightful extent, till,
			all doubts removed, he shouted out: &#8216;<em>Codfish! by thunder!</em>&#8217;</p>

			<p>We had actually taken within us, and bepraised, the unfreshened <em>tongues and bladders</em> of
			codfish!</p>

			<p>It is now more than a week, O <span class="special_name">Editor</span>! since this breakfast came off, or rather since it
			went down, for it isn&#8217;t <em>off</em> yet; even now, that taste<span class="keep_together">&#8212;&#8212;</span>Do you know what it is, Sir, to
			have your jaws hang?&#8212;to be always on the eve of a gape?&#8212;to be afraid of the tongs
			or the snuffers, or a tall man, especially in tights, lest the next yawn may wholly tear up
			your spinous process, your spheroid cartilage?&#8212;hang the doctors!&#8212;do you understand?
			Well; <em>I am in that way;</em> and it&#8217;s all from those confounded Zounds and Sounds!</p>

				the opera, we found the following, written in what Mrs. <span class="special_name">Malaprop</span> would term &#8216;rather
				ineligible characters,&#8217; as if hastily reduced to paper. Howbeit, we knew it at once for
				the &#8216;hand-write&#8217; of our favorite, facile and felicitous historian of Tinnecum. He is one
				of your persons now who thinks, and not a member of that hum-drum class who only <em>think</em>
				they think; moreover, he knows &#8216;how to observe&#8217; better even than Miss <span class="special_name">Martineau</span>. It
				was an every-day thing which struck him, in the aspect of our winter-sleighs, as he rode
				up in one of them a day or two ago; but this sketch of &#8216;<i>The Snow-Omnibus</i>&#8217; is not so common:
				&#8216;<span class="first_word">Past</span> midnight! The embers are dying. The thunder of the city becomes a dull
				roar, the roar a murmur: then comes a dead pause, interrupted sometimes by the watchman&#8217;s
				club as it rings on the pavement, or the shrill, solitary whistler executing the threadbare
				airs of the opera, or &#8216;Life on the Ocean Wave.&#8217; The door opens without noise. I
				lift up my nodding head and see Dr. <span class="special_name">Bartolo</span>, his hat like a miller&#8217;s, and his whiskers
				fringed with white. With tread soft as a mouse or an apparition, he illumes his candle,
				turns on his heel, and says in a whisper very appropriate to the time, the place, and the
				fact conveyed: &#8216;It snows!&#8217; Such is the only intimation to break the magic and the mystery
				of the early morning, unless it be the small tinkling of bells like frogs in a brook; a complete
				shifting or rather change of scene noiselessly wrought; a foul city purified, whitened,
				sparkling, and glorious, like a Scarlet Lady who emerges with her meretricious charms in
				chaste robes, chaste as Diana. She taketh the veil. The virgin-snow is unsullied upon her
				bosom, just as it dropped softly out of heaven, undefiled by footsteps, dazzling only to conceal.
				&#8217;Tis but the momentary semblance of purity. The sun is up. Hark! the tumult
				and excitement is begun. The crowds throng and jostle through the pure element; the
				horses prance to the gay and perpetual chimes, and Broadway is the paradise of belles.
				Underneath all is the obscenity of filth! What attracts our attention, however, is your
				snow-omnibus, very different in looks, spirit and animation from the same lumbering carriage
				upon wheels. What do you see in the latter? A set of cross, hungry-looking men,
				going up town to dinner, packed together in a magnetizing attitude, with knees jammed
				against knees, and eyes wherever they can find a place to put them; women crushed between
				stout fellows, and indecently nudged at every apology of a jolt; in short, a penthouse
				of ill-humour; twelve &#8216;<em>all full</em>&#8217; people; whiskerandi, gentle maidens, wives, and
				&#8216;live widders,&#8217; ranged with solemn regularity like coffins in a vault. All fix their eyes
				where their minds are, on vacuity, and try to <em>be</em> for the time present, what they <em>seem</em> to be,
				as stupid as the devil, as if they dreaded some sympathetic contact, revealing bank-frauds
				and transactions in stocks. Who ever saw a smile in an omnibus, even when court-plasters
				have changed places? You might as well look into a slow-driven hearse for something
				sunshiny! Your broker dares not even chuckle. Your exquisite cannot resort for consolation
				to the suction of his cane, but all look grim and virtuous as Seneca, until they pull the
				leather, pass up six-pence through the port-hole, and as they open the door, their faces
				begin to expand, but only with the animal anticipation of dinner. Compare this with
				the <em>grouping</em> and animation of the Sleigh-omnibus; heads piled upon heads, as in a picture;
				black hats, feathers, plumage, barrel-caps, etc., bobbing about in a lively manner
				to the music of bells. Down they go into the gullies, through thick and thin, with a
				ludicrous contrast and juxtaposition of faces; all forced in spite of themselves to give expression
				to their several humors, mirth, deviltry, or spleen. Cheeks glow, eyes shine,
				spectacles sparkle, glances fly impudently to the windows where the face of beauty presses
				against the cold pane. The runner sinks into a &#8216;rut,&#8217; and that makes the company bow
				to each other, and gives that old rascal of a sexegenarian an excuse to bring his gray whiskers
				very near to the blooming visage of a girl whose charming modesty is shrined in colors
				more delicate than the blush on the cheek of a magnum-bonum plum. Sixty must not
				aspire after such fruitage; but in an <em>omnibus</em>, where&#8217;s the harm? But we have a remark
				<span class="pagenum"><a id="page397" name="page397"></a>397</span>to make on <i>nosology</i>, or the noses of the group. So spicy a variety of folk cheek-by-jowl
				(Parthians and Elamites, Medes, Jews and Persians,) begets contrast. Nose-bridges of all
				styles show their peculiar architecture, Roman or Grecian; while straight, crooked, bottle,
				snub, pug; some flat and with no bridge at all, others very much <em>abridged</em>; are brought
				together in an amicable jostling, &#8216;comparing themselves by themselves,&#8217; and setting off one
				another as a rose sets off a geranium. While I point out these peculiarities to my friend
				<span class="special_name">Phiz</span>, a coral shriek rends the air, and by heavens! the whole load is upset!&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">We</span>

				<p><span class="first_word">If</span> there be not a fruitful lesson in the subjoined, which we venture to separate from its
				context in a recent letter from an esteemed friend and contributor, then we&#8212;are mistaken:
				&#8216;<span class="special_name">Apropos</span> of &#8216;American Ptyalism,&#8217; in your March number: a friend was telling me the
				other day of the agonies he had suffered from dispensing with the use of tobacco. He had
				used it in various ways for thirty years, but finding that he was breaking <em>down</em> under it,
				he broke <em>off</em> abruptly, about a year ago. &#8216;Let a tobacco-chewer,&#8217; said he, &#8216;who wishes
				to know what <em>nerves</em> are, abstain for only one day, and if he has a wife who is delicate
				and nervous, he will forever after look upon her with a sympathy that he never felt before.
				Why, Sir, for months after I had forsworn tobacco, my mouth and jaws were any thing
				but flesh and bone. They were fire, ice, and prussic-acid, alternately. The roof of my
				mouth would at one moment have the feeling of blistering, and the next of freezing; and
				in addition to that, needles would occasionally pierce my face in every imaginable way.
				My head, for the most part, was a large hogshead with a bumble-bee in it, and the bung
				stopped up. You know that I am not imaginative; but my teeth, Sir, would suddenly
				grow to the length of a mastodon&#8217;s, and perhaps five minutes after, (if at the table,) a narcotic
				deadness would take the place of the previous excitement, and I would seem to be
				mumbling my food like people whose teeth are gone. But in the street, I always seemed
				to be grinning at every body, like some horrible beast who couldn&#8217;t get his mouth shut.
				If you have ever stayed <em>agape</em> for an hour or so, while the doctor was on his way to reset
				your jaws, you can imagine how distressingly <em>public</em> that feeling is. One bitter cold night
				I woke on the cellar-stairs, having got that far in search of tobacco, in my night-dress.
				Did you ever do so? You may think it trifling; but whenever from any cause you have
				become nervous, the first night that you wake on the cellar-stairs in the dark will be something
				to remember. At another time I dreamed of dying. I had been long sick and had
				<span class="pagenum"><a id="page398" name="page398"></a>398</span>wasted to a mere nothing; but having had abundant time to prepare for death, I flattered
				myself that I was quite ready to go; and indeed, my hold upon life was so feeble, (a slight
				change in the weather would have snapped it, so it seemed,) my very breath was so
				fluttering and unsatisfactory, that I thought it would be as well perhaps to have done with
				it. The faces of friends, and the out-door world, with all its many goings-on, were pleasant
				to behold, but <em>faintly</em> so&#8212;indistinctly; my pulsations had gone down to such extreme
				tenuity, that the effort of getting at a pleasure killed it. But I was mistaken; for just
				before dying, the thought of my cigars came to me like a blessing; and although my physician
				told me I had but a few moments to live, I would not be refused. A cigar was
				brought; I seized it in my bony fingers, held it up to the light, smelt of it, and fondled it
				till the light was brought; and then, with what little grace my strength would allow, I
				inhaled that divine tobacco! How complacently, as far as I was able, did I then look
				around upon my surviving friends! My eyes, however, closed very soon from languor, and
				my breath now coming only at rather long intervals, the puffs were far between; notwithstanding
				which, I lived it through to the last inspiration; but in the closing draught, the fire
				from the cigar burnt my mouth so badly that I&#8212;awoke, and found I had actually bitten
				my lip in a most shocking manner! Well, Sir, you may think it was pleasant <em>not</em> to be
				dying, and so it was; but as I then felt, I think I would sooner have gone, if I could have
				taken with me the fragrance of that incomparable regalia.&#8221; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">Our</span> new friend, the

				prefer, prose or poetry?&#8217; We hardly know what to say, in answer to this categorical query.

				&#8216;not likely to last long, eh, Sir?&#8217; &#8216;A little slight, praps,&#8217; replies the shopman; &#8216;rather a
				delicate texture; but mourning ought not to last forever, Sir.&#8217; &#8216;No,&#8217; grumbles the Squire;
				&#8216;it seldom does, &#8217;specially the violent sorts.&#8217; &#8216;As to mourning, Ma&#8217;am,&#8217; continues the shopman,
				addressing the lady, &#8216;there has been a great deal, a very great deal indeed, this
				season; and several new fabrics have been introduced, to meet the demand for fashionable
				tribulation, and all in the French style; they of France excel in the <i>funÃ¨bre</i>. Here for
				instance is an article for the deeply-afflicted; a black crape, expressly adapted to the profound
				style of mourning; makes up very sombre and interesting. Or, if you prefer to
				mourn in velvet, here&#8217;s a very rich one; real Genoa, and a splendid black; we call it the
				&#8216;Luxury of Woe.&#8217; It&#8217;s only eighteen shillings a yard, and a superb quality; fit, in short,
				for the handsomest style of domestic calamity.&#8217; Here the Squire wants to know &#8216;whether
				sorrow gets more superfine as it goes upward in life.&#8217; &#8216;Certainly&#8212;yes, Sir&#8212;by all
				means,&#8217; responds the clerk; &#8216;at least, a finer texture. The mourning of poor people is very
				coarse, very; quite different from that of persons of quality. Canvass to crape, Sir.&#8217;
				The lady next asks if he has a variety of half-mourning; to which he replies: &#8216;O, infinite&#8212;the
				largest stock in town; full, and half, and quarter, and half-quarter mourning,
				shaded off from a <i>grief prononcÃ©</i> to the slightest <i>nuance</i> of regret.&#8217; The lady is directed
				to another counter, and introduced to &#8216;the gent. who superintends the Intermediate Sorrow
				Department;&#8217; who inquires: &#8216;You wish to inspect some half-mourning, Madam?
				the second stage of distress? As such Ma&#8217;am, allow me to recommend this satin&#8212;intended
				for grief when it has subsided; alleviated, you see, Ma&#8217;am, from a dead black to a
				dull lead color. It&#8217;s a Parisian novelty, Ma&#8217;am, called &#8216;Settled Grief,&#8217; and is very
				much worn by ladies of a certain age, who do not intend to embrace Hymen a second
				time.&#8217; (&#8216;Old women, mayhap, about seventy,&#8217; mutters the Squire.) &#8216;Exactly so, Sir;
				or thereabout. Not but what some ladies, Ma&#8217;am, set in for sorrow much earlier; indeed,
				in the prime of life; and for such cases it is a very durable wear; but praps it&#8217;s too
				<i>lugubre</i>: now here&#8217;s another&#8212;not exactly black, but shot with a warmish tint, to suit a
				woe moderated by time. The French call it a &#8216;Gleam of Comfort.&#8217; We&#8217;ve sold several
				pieces of it; it&#8217;s very attractive; we consider it the happiest pattern of the season.&#8217; &#8216;Yes,&#8217;
				once more interposes the Squire; &#8216;some people are very happy in it no doubt.&#8217; &#8216;No doubt,
				Sir. There&#8217;s a charm in melancholy, Sir. I&#8217;m fond of the pensive myself. Praps,
				Madam, you would prefer something still more in the transition state, as we call it, from
				grave to gay. In that case, I would recommend this lavender Ducape, with only just a
				souvenir of sorrow in it; the slightest tinge of mourning, to distinguish it from the garb of
				pleasure. But possibly you desire to see an appropriate style of costume for the juvenile
				branches, when sorrow their young days has shaded? Of course, a milder degree of
				mourning than for adults. Black would be precocious. This, Ma&#8217;am, for instance&#8212;a
				dark pattern on gray; an interesting dress, Ma&#8217;am, for a little girl, just initiated in the
				vale of tears; only eighteen-pence a yard Ma&#8217;am, and warranted to wash.&#8217; The &#8216;Intermediate
				Sorrow Department,&#8217; however, derives no patronage from the &#8216;hard customer;&#8217;
				and we next find her in the &#8216;Coiffure Department,&#8217; looking at caps, and interrogating a
				show-woman in deep mourning, who is in attendance, and enlarging upon the beauty of
				<span class="pagenum"><a id="page400" name="page400"></a>400</span>her fabrics: &#8216;This is the newest style, Ma&#8217;am. Affliction is very much modernized, and
				admits of more <i>gout</i> than formerly. Some ladies indeed for their morning grief wear rather
				a plainer cap; but for evening sorrow, this is not at all too <i>ornÃ©e</i>. French taste has introduced
				very considerable alleviations.&#8217; Failing however, in &#8216;setting her <em>caps</em>&#8217; for the new
				customer, the show-woman &#8216;tries the handkerchief&#8217; enticement; exhibiting one with a
				fringe of artificial tears worked on the border&#8212;&#8216;the &#8216;<i>Larmoyante</i>,&#8217; a sweet-pretty idea.&#8217;
				The Squire intimates that as a handkerchief <em>to be used</em>, it would most likely be found
				&#8216;rather scrubby for the eyes.&#8217; But the show-woman removes <em>this</em> objection: &#8216;O dear, no,
				Sir&#8212;if you mean wiping. The wet style of grief is quite gone out&#8212;quite! The dry
				cry is decidedly the genteel thing.&#8217; No wonder that the Squire, as he left the establishment
				with his &#8216;better half,&#8217; was fain to exclaim: &#8216;Humph! And so that&#8217;s a Mason de Dool!
				Well! if it&#8217;s all the same to you, Ma&#8217;am, I&#8217;d rather die in the country, and be universally
				lamented after the old fashion; for, as to London, what with the new French modes of
				mourning, and the &#8216;Try Warren&#8217; style of blacking the premises, it do seem to me that
				before long all sorrow will be sham Abram, and the House of Mourning a regular

				<p><span class="first_word">We</span> have just received the following from an esteemed correspondent, who transcribes it
				verbatim from the familiar letter of a friend. If we have a solitary reader who can peruse
				it without emotion, let him confine his indifference within his own cold bosom:</p>

				<div class="quotation">
					<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">I have</span> just returned from the funeral of poor <span class="special_name">Emma</span> <span class="keep_together">G&#8212;&#8212;,</span> a little girl to whom I had been for
					years most tenderly attached. As there was something very touching in the circumstances connected
					with her death, I will relate them to you. She was the daughter of a widow, a near neighbor of mine.
					When I first knew her, she was a sprightly child of about four years of age, perfect in form and feature.
					The bloom of health was on her cheek; her eye was the brightest I ever saw; while in her
					bosom there glowed a generous affection that seemed to embrace all with whom she came in contact.
					But when she reached her seventh year, her health began to decline. The rose suddenly paled on her
					cheek, and her eye had acquired prematurely that sad, thoughtful expression which gives so melancholy
					a charm to the features of wasting beauty. Her mother looked on with an anxious heart and
					at an utter loss to account for so sudden a change in her health. But soon a new source of anxiety appeared.
					While dressing her one day, she observed on <span class="special_name">Emma&#8217;s</span> back, just between the shoulders, a
					small swelling, of about the size of a walnut. As she watched this spot, and observed that it grew
					larger from day to day, the mother began to have sad misgivings. These however she kept to herself
					for a time. Soon afterward, a slight stoop in her gait became visible. The family physician was
					<span class="pagenum"><a id="page401" name="page401"></a>401</span>now called in, and the worst forebodings of the mother were confirmed. Her idolized child was
					fast becoming a hump-back!</p>

					<p>&#8216;I will not attempt to describe the feelings of the mother, who was thus doomed to witness from
					day to day the slow growth of that which was to make one so dear to her a cripple and a dwarf. Suffice
					it to say, her love as well as care seemed to be redoubled, and <span class="special_name">Emma</span> became more than ever the
					child of her affections. Nor did her little companions neglect her when she could no longer join in
					their out-door sports, and her own sprightly step had given place to a slow, stooping-gait, and the
					sweet ringing voice to a sad or querulous tone, that sometimes made the very heart ache. On the
					contrary, all vied with each other in administering to her amusements. Among them, none clung to
					her with more assiduity than her brother <span class="special_name">William</span>, who was the nearest to her own age. He gave
					up all his own out-door play, in order to be with her, and seemed never so happy as when he could
					draw a smile, sad though it was, from her thoughtful features. But after a while, <span class="special_name">Emma</span> grew wayward
					under her affliction; and unfortunately, though generally good-natured, <span class="special_name">William</span> had a quick
					temper, to check which required more self-command than commonly falls to one so young. Sometimes,
					therefore, when he found plan after plan, which he had projected for her amusement, rejected
					with peevish contempt, he could hardly conceal from her his own wounded feelings. Yet, though at
					times apparently ungrateful, <span class="special_name">Emma</span> was perhaps not so in fact; and she loved her brother better than
					any one else, save her mother. It was only in moments when her too sensitive nature had been chafed
					perhaps by her own reflections&#8212;for like the majority of children in her circumstances, she was
					thoughtful beyond her years&#8212;that her conduct seemed unkind. And then, when she marked the
					clouded expression of her brother&#8217;s face, she would ask forgiveness in so meek a spirit, and kiss his
					cheek so affectionately, that he forgave her almost as soon as offended.</p>

					<p>&#8216;Years thus passed on, when one day, after she had been more than usually perverse and fretful,
					<span class="special_name">William</span>, who had been reading to her, on receiving some slight rebuff, started suddenly from his
					seat by her side, called her &#8216;<em>a little hunch-back</em>,&#8217; and left the room. In a moment, however, his passion
					subsided, and returning, he found his sister in tears. He attempted to put his arm around her
					neck, but she repulsed him, and slipping away, retired to her own chamber. Her mother soon after
					learned what had happened, and going to <span class="special_name">Emma</span>, found her upon the bed in a paroxysm of grief. She
					endeavored to soothe her feelings, but in vain; she refused to be comforted. &#8216;I want to <em>die</em>, mother,&#8217;
					she replied to all her endearments; &#8216;I have long felt that I was a burden to you all.&#8217; She cried herself
					to sleep that night, and on the morrow was too ill to rise. The doctor was called in, and warned
					the mother against an approaching fever. For three days she remained in an uncertain state; but on
					the fourth, the fever came in earnest, and thenceforth she was confined to her pillow.</p>

					<p>&#8216;In the mean time, the grief of <span class="special_name">William</span> had been more poignant even than that of his sister.
					Thrice he had been to her bedside to ask her forgiveness, and kiss once more her pallid cheek; but
					she turned her face resolutely away, and refused to recognize him. After these repulses he would
					slowly leave the room, and going to his own chamber, sit brooding for hours over the melancholy
					consequences of his rashness. Owing to the previous enfeebled health of <span class="special_name">Emma</span>, the fever made
					rapid progress, and it soon became apparent that she must die. <span class="special_name">William</span>, in consequence of the
					violent aversion of his sister, had latterly been denied admittance to the chamber, though he lingered
					all day about the door, eagerly catching the least word in regard to her state, and apparently unmindful
					of all other existence.</p>

					<p>&#8216;One morning there was evidently a crisis approaching; for the mother and attendants, hurrying
					softly in and out the sufferer&#8217;s chamber, in quick whispered words gave orders or imparted
					intelligence to others. <span class="special_name">William</span> saw it all, and with the quick instinct of affection, seemed to know
					what it foreboded. Taking his little stool, therefore, he sat down beside the chamber-door, and
					waited in silence. In the mean time, the mother stood over the dying child, watching while a short
					unquiet slumber held her back for a little while longer. Several times a sweet smile trembled round
					the sufferer&#8217;s lips, and her arms moved as if pressing something to her bosom. Then she awoke, and
					fixing her eyes upon her mother, whispered faintly, &#8216;I thought <span class="special_name">William</span> was here.&#8217; A stifled sob
					was heard at the door, which stood partly open. Mrs. <span class="keep_together">G&#8212;&#8212;</span> stepped softly out, and leading <span class="special_name">William</span>
					to the bed-side, pointed to his dying sister. He threw himself upon her bosom, and pressing his
					lips to her pale cheek, prayed for forgiveness. <span class="special_name">Emma</span> did not heed him; but looking again in her
					mother&#8217;s face, and pointing upward, said softly: &#8216;I shant be so <em>there!</em>&#8212;shall I, mother?&#8217;</p>

					<p>&#8216;No, my poor child!&#8217; replied the weeping parent; &#8216;I hope not. But don&#8217;t talk <em>so</em>, <span class="special_name">Emma</span>. Forgive
					your poor brother, or you&#8217;ll break his heart.&#8217;</p>

					<p>&#8216;<span class="special_name">Emma</span> tried to gasp something; but whatever it was, whether of love or hate, it never reached a
					mortal ear. In a few moments she was no more.&#8217;</p>

				<p>and the mysterious realm that lies beyond its visible confines. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">We</span> select from the
				&#8216;<i>Random Reminiscences of a Retired Merchant</i>&#8217; a single passage; the entire article being
				quite too short for any other department of our work: &#8216;There once flourished in one
				of our commercial cities a little French merchant, who was very well known to every
				man and boy by the fact of his being always followed by a curly-haired yellow dog with
				his tail &#8216;cut a little too short by a <span class="keep_together">d&#8212;&#8212;d</span> sight!&#8217; During the last war, our little Frenchman
				was doing a very thriving business in the dry-goods line, and was supposed to be a little
				sharper at a bargain than any of his fellow-tradesmen. There also flourished at the same
				time, in the same city, an importing merchant of Yankee origin, who was noted as a long-headed,
				close-fisted dealer. It is well known that during the war English goods were sold
				at enormous prices. The Yankee merchant was in that line of trade; and a few days
				before the arrival in this country of the news of peace, he received private advices from
				the Continent which led him to anticipate it. As he had a large supply of English goods
				on hand at the time, the prices of which would of course instantly fall, he set about disposing
				of them as soon as possible to his less informed and unsuspecting customers. The
				little Frenchman was one of his victims. After much haggling, and the offer of a long
				credit, the importer effected a bill of sale of goods to him, to the amount of something like
				twenty thousand dollars, taking his notes on long time in payment. These he considered
				perfectly good, of course, as his customer&#8217;s reputation in the money-market was unsullied.
				The bargain being consummated, the two friends parted, each in a capital humor with
				<span class="pagenum"><a id="page403" name="page403"></a>403</span>himself; the Yankee to deposit the notes in his strong box, and the Frenchman to his
				store, where, receiving his newly-purchased goods, he immediately commenced marking
				them one hundred per cent. above cost, thus making before midnight, to use his own
				boast, a <em>profit</em> of twenty thousand dollars on his purchase! Three days afterward the
				official news of peace came; English goods instantly fell one half, and our little Frenchman
				awoke in horror from his dream of cent. per cent. Nine persons out of every ten
				under such circumstances would have failed at once. But <i>nil desperandum</i> was the motto
				of our Frenchman. He saw that he had been &#8216;<em>bit</em>&#8217; by his commercial friend, and he
				immediately set his wits at work to turn the tables upon him. So, late in the evening of
				the next day he repaired to the dwelling of the importer, and told a long and pitiful story
				of his embarrassments. He said his conscience already smote him for making so heavy a
				purchase while in failing circumstances, and that he had come to make the only reparation
				in his power; namely, to yield up the goods obtained of the importer, on the latter&#8217;s cancelling
				the notes given therefor. The Yankee at first demurred; but on the Frenchman
				insisting that he was a bankrupt, and that he feared the moment he opened in the morning
				the sheriff would pounce upon him with a writ that would swallow up every thing, he
				finally agreed to the proposition. &#8216;Half a loaf was better than no bread,&#8217; he thought;
				and so the notes and the bill of sale were accordingly cancelled. By daylight in the
				morning the Yankee was at the Frenchman&#8217;s store, with his teams, as had been agreed
				upon the night before, and every package of his goods was soon removed. The two
				merchants again parted, the Frenchman with a mind relieved of a heavy load, and the
				Yankee rather down in the mouth at the result of his trade. Two or three days afterward,
				as the importer was passing the Frenchman&#8217;s store, he observed his sign still up,
				and every thing apparently as flourishing as ever. He stepped in to see what it all meant.
				&#8216;Hallo! Mr. <span class="keep_together">S&#8212;&#8212;,&#8217;</span> said he, &#8216;I thought you had failed!&#8217; &#8216;<em>Failed!</em>&#8217; repeated the Frenchman,
				thrusting his thumbs in the arm-holes of his vest, and sliding his legs apart from
				counter to counter, till he resembled a small Colossus of Rhodes: &#8216;<em>Failed?</em> No, be
				gar! Firmer than ever, Mr. <span class="keep_together">H&#8212;&#8212;,</span> but I <em>should</em> have failed, <em>almosht</em>, if I hadn&#8217;t got

				<div class="quotation">
					<p>&#8216;<span class="special_name">Mr. Speaker</span>: I feel incompetent to measure this comprehensive subject. Were my thoughts as
					deep as the Mississippi, and as clear as the Ohio, I could not grasp its whole magnitude. It requires
					a mighty mind; one that can look beyond the landscape; he must be able to look even beyond the
					ocean; to grapple with all the intricacies and winding convolutions of the subject, and to map in his
					mind the whole length and breadth of its territories. Here, Sir, is a river, whose broad and deep
					stream meanders from Paducah through one of the most fertile tobacco countries in the world, to
					Ross&#8217;s landing, and at the terminus of the great Charleston railroad, and possessing a steam navigation

				<p><span class="first_word">Every-body</span> has heard of the good old lady who purchased a family Bible at a bookstore,

								<p><span class="special_name">Lord</span>, &#8217;tis not ours to make the sea</p>
								<p>And earth and sky a home for Thee;</p>

							</div>

					</div>
					<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">Many</span> years ago, when &#8216;the dew of the morning was fresh upon me,&#8217; there stood, just in the edge of
					the village where I was born, an old church edifice. The graves of many an early settler were round
					about it; and often as the shadows of evening were settling upon the valley, with half-averted face
					and hurried steps have I stole noiselessly by to our rural home. O, how many associations crowd upon
					the memory, in connection with that rude old meeting-house! It was an old-fashioned, square building,
					without portico, or steeple, or belfry. The winter&#8217;s hail and summer&#8217;s rain had beaten against it for
					half a century. Its numerous small windows, without curtain or blind, let in floods of light. Its
					small pulpit, perched high upon one side, and close to the wall, concealed the preacher&#8217;s body, while
					the heads of the congregation were just seen rising above the square high-backed pews. Hardly a
					cushion was to be seen; and the interior furnishing was of the simplest and plainest character. I have
					said that it had associations of great interest. It is now more than an hundred years since a small
					band of Scotch-Irish Presbyterians settled in that valley. Though but few in number, and braving
					the elements and the savages, they determined to carry with them into the wilderness not only the
					Christian&#8217;s hope, but the Christian&#8217;s ordinances. A small building of logs arose soon after the settlement,
					in which for many years an educated and regularly-ordained minister preached the gospel to
					a little flock. The inquiry had already commenced; &#8216;The prophets, where are they?&#8217; The larger
					part of the pioneers had sunk into peaceful graves, when the war of the revolution commenced. It
					was still a frontier hamlet, and was soon swallowed up and lost in that terrible whirlwind of death
					which year after year swept over the settlements of Central New-York. When peace was restored,
					the remnant of the inhabitants whom war and disease had spared, returned to their former homes.
					But though war and disease had impoverished them, they had not forgotten the <span class="special_name">God</span> of their fathers.
					Having no house for assembling together, the inhabitants met in what they termed &#8216;the meeting-house
					yard;&#8217; and there organized anew that church which has continued thence to this day, and determined
					upon the erection of the old meeting-house of which I have spoken. Under the open heavens, with
					their feet upon their fathers&#8217; graves, they dedicated themselves anew to the service of <span class="special_name">Him</span> who was
					<span class="special_name">Lord</span> overall, and whom they acknowledged as their only Sovereign. I have looked over the records
					of that meeting with emotions never to be forgotten. The gray-haired patriarch, loaning on his staff
					with one hand, and with the other guiding our youthful footsteps to the house of prayer on every
					Sabbath morning, was one of that small number, and took an active part in that solemn ceremony.
					The stillness of a Sabbath morning in the country has often been remarked. How often, amid the
					din and bustle of the great city, does the heart of him who has been accustomed to the holy quietness
					of the day of rest in some secluded valley, pant for a return to the home of his youth! Such has been
					my own experience; in the far-off past I see again the gathering of the quiet, orderly congregation;
					I hear the voice of the good old father who ministered in holy things; I sit by the open window and
					<span class="pagenum"><a id="page405" name="page405"></a>405</span>look out upon the green graves thick strown round the old meeting-house; the warbling of the feathered
					songsters in the grove near by falls softly upon the ear. The voice of prayer is hushed, and
					the voice of praise ascends. Alas! the voices of most of those which were then attuned on earth,
					are now attuned to more celestial music in another world!</p>

					<p>&#8216;But our old meeting-house, where is it? It has gone with those who, in the midst of trials, and in
					the plenitude of their poverty, with their own hands hewed out its massive timbers; and the place that
					knew it knows it no more! It was in the fall of the year that a traveller on horseback rode up to the
					principal hotel, and as he dismounted and handed the reins to his host, he inquired what building that
					was in the southern part of the village? On being informed that it was the meeting-house, he remarked,
					with a dogged air, that &#8216;he had often seen the <span class="special_name">Lord&#8217;s</span> house, but had never seen the <span class="special_name">Lord&#8217;s</span>
					<em>barn</em> before!&#8217; The comical remark of the traveller produced an immediate action. The good old
					house soon disappeared. A more ambitious edifice was built in another part of the village. The
					land-marks are now entirely effaced, and the spot where it stood has been added to the &#8216;meeting-house
					yard.&#8217; The monuments of the young and the aged who sleep there dot over the place where
					the first Presbyterian congregation, ay, the first congregation of Evangelical Christians of any denomination,
					in Central New-York, assembled to worship the living <span class="special_name">God</span>.&#8217;</p>

				<p><span class="first_word">We</span> are promised by an esteemed friend some interesting extracts from the original
				American correspondence of Mrs. <span class="special_name">Grant</span> of Laggan, whose &#8216;Memoir and Correspondence,&#8217;
				edited by her son, has recently attracted so much attention and remark in Great-Britain.
				Mrs. <span class="special_name">Grant</span> appears to have been a woman of very remarkable powers, and of the most
				admirable <em>common sense</em>. Her observations upon the &#8216;amusive talents&#8217; of <span class="special_name">Theodore

				The distinction between living to amuse the public merely, and the exertion of one&#8217;s intellectual

				discriminated and set forth. There is not perhaps a more instructive lesson than that
				conveyed by <em>professional</em> wits, who are &#8216;first applauded and then <em>endured</em>, when people
				see that it is all they have.&#8217; As auxiliaries, as contrasts, with reflection and thoughtful
				exercitations of the mind, wit and humor are felicitous matters; as an intellectual <em>main-stay</em>,
				however, they have been weighed in the balance by a hundred brilliant examples,

					cuffs of their jackets instead of sponges, with an occasional recourse to the pocket-handkerchief.
					The author found, in schools in which the Latin language was not taught, a lamentable deficiency in
					the knowledge of the meaning of &#8216;meum&#8217; and &#8216;tuum;&#8217; he pointed out how the great extent of juvenile

				<p>We have had books on etiquette, of various kinds, lately, but a work of this sort for
				prisons will be found, one would think, to supply an important desideratum. <span class="special_name">George
				Selwyn</span>, when a servant was sent to Newgate, for stealing articles from the club-house of
				which <span class="special_name">Selwyn</span> was a member, was very much shocked: &#8216;What a horrid report,&#8217; said he,
				<span class="pagenum"><a id="page406" name="page406"></a>406</span>&#8216;the fellow will give of us to the gentlemen in Newgate!&#8217; This feeling will doubtless be
				more general by and by:</p>

				<div class="quotation">
					<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">In</span> consequence of complaints that have been made by persons committed to prison before trial, who
					object to their not being allowed to mix with other prisoners, it has been thought necessary to frame a
					Book of Etiquette for prison purposes. Of course a superior delinquent, like a forger, could not be
					on visiting terms with a mere pick-pocket, nor could a man charged with stealing a hundred pounds,
					feel at his ease in the society of one whose alleged theft might be mean and insignificant. It is, we
					believe, intended to introduce the prisoners to each other formally, not by name, but by the offence
					with which they are charged. Thus, the Governor of Newgate would say to Felony: &#8216;Allow me to
					introduce you to <span class="special_name">Aggravated Larceny</span>. You ought to know each other&#8212;indeed you ought. <span class="special_name">Aggravated
					Larceny</span>, <span class="first_word">Felony</span>; <span class="first_word">Felony</span>, <span class="first_word">Aggravated Larceny</span>.&#8217; By a nice adjustment and proper
					application of the rules of etiquette, a very admirable system of social intercourse might be established
					in all our prisons, and the present complaint of a want of &#8216;good society,&#8217; which falls so severely
					on superior scoundrels, would at once be got rid of.&#8217;</p>

				&#8216;Among the guests was a Mr. <span class="keep_together">L&#8212;&#8212;,</span> (one of the <i>snobiculi</i>, most likely,) who, believing

					&#8216;Even then, though we may get rid of a few copies to the circulating libraries,&#8217; he would
					observe, &#8216;do not expect, Sir, to obtain readers. A few old maids in the county towns, and a few
					gouty old gentlemen at the clubs, are the only persons of the present day who ever open a book!&#8217;
					And who can wonder? <em>Who</em> has leisure to read? <em>Who</em> cares to sit down and spell out accounts of
					travels which he can make at less cost than the cost of the narrative? <em>Who</em> wants to peruse fictitious
					adventures, when rail-roads and steam-boats woo him to adventures of his own? People are busy
					ballooning or driving; shooting like stars along rail-roads, or migrating like swallows or wild-geese.&#8217;</p>

				<p>In allusion to the illustrated newspapers, now vieing with each other in enterprise and
				expense, in the British metropolis, the writer says: &#8216;The pictorial printing press is now
				your only wear! Every thing is communicated by delineation. We are not <em>told</em> but <em>shown</em>
				how the world is wagging. Views of the Holy Land are superseding even the Holy Scriptures,
				and a pictorial <span class="special_name">Blackstone</span> is teaching the ideas of sucking lawyers how to shoot.
				Libels are veiled in carricature. Instead of <em>writing</em> slander and flat blasphemy, the modern
				method is to <em>draw</em> it, and not to &#8216;draw it mild&#8217; either. The columns of certain papers bear
				a striking likeness to a child&#8217;s alphabet, such as &#8216;A was an Archer, and shot at a frog.&#8217;
				All the world is now instructed by symbols, as formerly the deaf and dumb. We have
				little doubt of shortly seeing announcements, standing like tomb-stones in those literary
				cemeteries, the Saturday papers, of &#8216;A new work upon America, from the graver of
				<span class="special_name">George Cruikshank</span>;&#8217; or &#8216;A new fashionable novel, (diamond edition,) from the accomplished
				pencil of <span class="keep_together">&#8216;H. B.&#8217;&#8217;</span> <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">We</span> have a &#8216;<i>Query</i>&#8217; from a Philadelphia correspondent, as
				to whether Mr. and Mrs. <span class="special_name">Wood</span> would not be likely to come over here, if invited, and in
				company with <span class="special_name">Brough</span>, and other artists, establish English opera among us. Touching
				the disposition of the <span class="special_name">Woods</span> in this matter, we know nothing; but <span class="special_name">Brough</span> is too busily
				employed to admit of such a consummation. What with his agency for the new sporting
				gun-powder, (which <span class="special_name">Daniel Webster</span> declares to be superior in strength and cleanliness
				to any other thing of the kind in the world,) and for the &#8216;Illustrated London News,&#8217; &#8216;Old
				<span class="special_name">Parr&#8217;s</span> Life-pills&#8217; etc., he has scarcely leisure to achieve his private calls, and execute
				occasionally, for the gratification of his friends, those charming airs which are indissolubly
				associated with his name. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> Messrs. <span class="special_name">Snelling and Tisdale&#8217;s</span> &#8216;<i>Metropolitan Library
				and Reading-Room</i>,&#8217; at 599 Broadway, near Houston-street, supplies an important desideratum
				in that quarter of the metropolis. In addition to a well-stocked library and reading-room,
				there are coffee, conversation, chess, and cigar-apartments, and all the belongings of
				a first establishment after its kind. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">We</span> had clipped for insertion, from a Baltimore
				journal, a poem in honor of <span class="special_name">Ole Bull</span>, entitled &#8216;<i>The Bewitched Fiddle</i>,&#8217; which we have
				unluckily mislaid or lost. It was by Mr. <span class="special_name">Hewitt</span>, a popular song-writer and musical composer,
				and was one of the most fanciful and felicitous things we have seen in a month of
				Sundays. As it is at this moment out of our power to print it, we can only counsel our
				readers, if they encounter it any where, not to fail of its perusal. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">We</span> have a pleasant
				metropolitan story to tell one of these days, (at least we think so,) of which we have been
				reminded by the following from a late English magazine:</p>
				<div class="quotation">
					<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">The</span> vulgar genteel are nervously cautious concerning every thing they say or do; they are ever
					alive to the dread of compromising their &#8216;gentility.&#8217; At a ball&#8212;it was a <em>charity</em>-ball!&#8212;given at a
					fashionable watering-place, a pretty young woman, who was sitting by her mother, was invited by a
					gentleman to dance. He led her to a set; when, instantly, two &#8216;young ladies&#8217; who were of it, haughtily,
					withdrew to their seats. &#8216;They had no notion of dancing in <em>such</em> company&#8217;&#8212;and with good reason.
					The young person was nothing more than the daughter of a wealthy and respectable tradesman of
					the place; while they&#8212;the two Misses <span class="special_name">Knibbs</span>&#8212;were members of its resident <em>small</em> &#8216;aristocracy.&#8217;
					The places they had vacated were good-naturedly filled by two ladies who had witnessed the proceeding,
					one of whom was the daughter, the other, the niece, of a nobleman. <em>Their</em> position was too
					well established to be compromised by dancing for a quarter of an hour in the same set with a respectable
					tradesman&#8217;s daughter; but the two Misses <span class="special_name">Knibbs</span> were the daughters of a retired soap-boiler.&#8217;</p>

				<p id="fn1"><span class="returnFN"><a href="#fnm1">Return to text</a></span><span class="first_word">This</span> route leads, among other villages, through that of Sevenoaks, famous as the place where
				Jack Cade and his rabble overthrew the forces of Stafford, in the very same year, (1450,)
				when Faust and Gutenberg set up the first press in Germany, and long, therefore, before Cade
				could have justly complained, as Shakspeare has made him do, that the Lord Say had &#8216;caused printing
				to be used&#8217; in England, and &#8216;built a paper-mill.&#8217; But who taxes the sun for his spots or Shakspeare
				for anachronisms? He who was born to exhaust and imagine worlds, cannot of course be denied
				some innocent liberties with chronology. The village in question, however, is more interesting
				to travellers from being in the vicinity of Knole, the fine old seat of the dukes of Dorset. The stranger
				is led here through long galleries garnished with furniture of the time of Elizabeth and hung with
				portraits which at every step recall names of the deepest historical interest. Who can ever forget
				that which hangs or hung over the door of Lady Betty Germaine&#8217;s chamber? It is Milton in the
				bloom of manhood, and the immortal epic seems to be just dawning on those mild and pensive
				features. One chamber, of sumptuous appointments remains, (so runs the legend,) as it was last
				tenanted by James I., no head less sapient or august having been since permitted to press the pillow.
				In another every thing stands as it was arranged for the reception of the second James, who forfeited,
				it seems, a luxurious lodging at Knole at the same time that he forfeited his crown. The name of
				Lady Betty Germaine, Swift&#8217;s friend and correspondent, connects the place with all the celebrities of
				the reign of Queen Anne. On emerging from the building we view the magnificent groves of the
				park, fit haunt for nightingales, though Becket is said to have driven them by an anathema from the
				neighborhood, because their songs interrupted his nocturnal meditations. But the memory of Thomas
				Sackville, Lord Buckhurst, (once proprietor of Knole,) the best poet of his time, and &#8216;the immediate
				father-in-verse of Spenser,&#8217; sufficiently redresses the stigma of so churlish a proscription, and
				the nightingales may well claim perpetual franchise under sanction of a name to which the ancient
				inscription would apply:</p>
